I've been pretty vocal at my job about just how powerful LLMs are at text classification. They take 0 training time and they work on just about any domain. They're basically universal text classifiers. 

I'm convinced that if someone built a universal text classifier of the same quality in 2020, it would have won a Turing award. Still floored that so few people have caught on. What a time to be alive!"	"1"

The trap of LLMs is they can do many things fairly well.

&gt;It's slower and more expensive, but I always start with GPT-4, the most powerful model available. My process is to use the **greediest** approach until the task is completed to a high standard, then figure out how to trim the fat later.

I've heard my manager (who was a software person, not data science) use the word \"greedy\" in this way before - meaning \"resource-intensive, long time, exhaustive, etc\".

But a greedy algorithm is one that is kind of the opposite.  At each step it just tries to maximize it's gain, without feeling ahead or using any other advanced technique.

Are there two different definitions of the word \"greedy\" in this domain?"	"2"

I think of greedy algorithms like electrons, always taking the path of least resistance. It's greedy in the colloquial sense because you choose what's best for you at the current step of the algorithm, without looking ahead to the downstream consequences.

The software version of greedy (I think) is only caring about optimizing a single objective with no regard for efficient resource consumption. I guess you could frame that as a greedy algorithm where your utility function is univariate. Downstream consequences of running out of resources would just be ignored. 

That's a bit of a shoehorn though lol."	"2_1"

This can increase model variance. Second potential issue is if you're using a tree-based model you're limited to using your new ordinal feature only one time in the tree. If you one-hot encoded you could use one of the resulting features at the top of the tree, and another down the branch.

Typically you would use target encoding for a high-cardinality feature if one-hot encoding would explode the feature space to the point that the model would be difficult to manage. If you can afford the added features I would stick to one-hot. Target encoding is a useful technique just be aware of the impact it may be having on the model you're training."	"1"

Train a very simple neural net to predict your target using your categorical feature, with a single embeddings later in between.

Like with target encoding, those embeddings are limited to describing the relationship between 1 feature and 1 target.  My team generates embeddings for several combinations of common predictive features and targets that can then be applied in many other predictive models.  Here are a couple examples:

I don't think this is true. Imagine for example an two category variable that you target encode, basically the tree model will test each node if splitting between category 1 and 2 will improve the model (like a binary feature) . In the three categories case it will do the same, but it will group the middle category with the lowest or the highest.

Are you sure you didn't leak test information? Make sure you didn't use the target values from the test data in the encoding, that might be why the performance looks so nice. Also, if you're just in the model development/validation stage, you should make sure you follow a similar approach to not leak the validation target values -- e.g. do the target encoding within each in-sample set when you score on the out-of-sample fold in CV.  


Target encoding can work well with proper treatment, but even when done properly the model might overfit to those features. In supervised settings, I generally trust the model to extract the right signal from categories instead of forcing it. In many modern libraries high cardinality is not an issue because there's handling for single-column categorical variables (lightgbm, neural network embeddings, etc.)"	"2"

I imagine it could also compound any biases/inaccuracies in your labeling, although that feels like a more minor concern.


The more widespread impact would be in how it transforms your feature space. Youre typically taking a fairly complex feature and mapping it to a very low dimensional space. Depending on exactly how you target-encode, that might help the model find patterns in the feature; but it could also obfuscate patterns or introduce artificial ones.

One thing to stress is that data is not going to be enough and domain knowledge needs to be injected throughout the process. 

The tools for inference and causality are going to be somewhat similar to the tools used for pure prediction. However, the mindset is going to be different: it's less about predictive accuracy and more about the data generating process and the inference you can make about it.

Thats the trade off of using a model focused on prediction instead of interpretability. Im not expert on this particular technique though, so I might be wrong here.

Looks like the scikit-learn doc page on this particular model cites [this text](https://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf). I quickly searched it and I see no exploration of causation here, but I would take a deep dive at that link if I were you!"	"3_1_1"

Let's say I have a variable y that I believe is linearly related to another variable x, so I construct the model y = bx + noise.

I don't know the true value of b, but I have some domain knowledge. Perhaps values in the range of -1 to 1 are reasonable for my application, but I'd be willing to bet my life savings against anything above 10. I can then construct a prior distribution to capture these beliefs.

Then, I receive a sample of data with x and y. With this sample of data, I can use Bayes' rule to update my beliefs and calculate a posterior distribution. Maybe after seeing the data, only values approximately in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 are credible. Note that for each value of b, there's a corresponding (linear) function that maps x to y. This helps with the intuition behind GPRs-- we're doing inference on a true underlying function.

Notice a few key features of this setup:

* We framed it as an inference problem rather than a prediction problem because we're trying to learn about b.
* We can't conclude causality without more information. Confounding factors could make it so that b captures correlation without causation, even though we're doing inference rather than prediction. If we had a well-controlled experiment, we could have made a stronger case for causality.
* We *could* use the exact same model to predict y based on x if that were the goal. Just like we can construct a posterior distribution for b, we can construct a *posterior predictive* distribution for a new y at a given value of x.

All of this applies to GPR as well. The only difference is that instead of having the model y = bx + noise (with a parameter b), GPRs basically allow us to use a MUCH more flexible model y = f(x). And through some beautiful math magic, we can actually specify a prior over f(x). Maybe in that prior distribution, a linear function is a possible draw."	"6"

It has helped me solidify my understanding of the role of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in relation to Bayesian and Frequentist approaches.

I'm curious if there is a way to construct a GPR model that enables the extraction of correlative information between features. In other words, can a GPR model be formulated to provide statistically valid insights into the relationships among the features?

From my current understanding, the answer seems to be no. By adopting a distribution over the function f(x) we sacrifice the ability to precisely determine the relationships between Y and X. In essence, we exchange the possibility of identifying a direct relationship between Y and X for the ability to describe how Y and X are related in a probabilistic sense."	"6_1"

A good python resource would be Harvard's free online course on edx, CS50's introduction to programming with python. I have not taken this course personally, but their other course with C is pure gold, and the professor is the same for this one. The downside is that it's probably totally unrelated to data science. 

If you are not a total novice in programming and know a bit of Python, you can check out a book called thinkstats2. It's a book about statistics in python. It's free on greenteapress(dot)com. There are other related books on that website by the same author.

Everything that you need is out there on the internet, and you have all the tools to find it (Google, CGPT, Gemini). Also, join communities on discord and reddit.

I started learning Data Science in 2019. Prior to this I used to make reports in excel as a full time job. Had an interview at FAANG company and realised the massive skill gap that I had. Started by watching YouTube videos to see if its my thing.

And apparently it was!! With only my experience of coding in Excel VBA, I jumped into the world of data science.

While the stats part didnt stick, I really took to Python, SQL and Tableau.

Started doing smaller projects with my mentors encouragement (I was aspiring to be on his team). Did a small proof of concept on attempting to predict hiring timelines depending on geography, skillset, grade etc. The project never saw the light of day but it was presented in many forums as our first foray into machine learning.

By this time I was good enough to watch tutorials and build working solutions out of them. Worked out how to implement Named Entity Recognition in 2 days and how to train an NER model by end of the week.

On the coming Monday Im meeting tech folks to see how we can use Apache Airflow within our area to streamline our Python based data pipelines.

If I can do all of that, I can assure you youd be fine. Id recommend learning and youd be find problems that you  can solve within your area. And trust me there are a lot of problems to be solved within in most non tech teams."	"13"

One additional point I'd like to make is that most of what are referred to as AI approaches, require very high sample sizes to shine, and in a lot of clinical trial settings, sample sizes are small. For instance:

* In a [recent paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.9931?af=R) Infante et al. (2023) confirm (again) that for survival outcomes, the sample size necessary for ML models is significantly higher than traditional models: \"*random forests requires at least 150% more than the minimum sample size suggested for traditional regression models, while neural networks requires about 200% the minimum sample size*\". Other papers had shown that in most scenarios it's difficult to beat the workhorse model (Cox PH).

* In a [recent paper](https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/dbds/documents/biostats-workshop/paper-1-.pdf), Efron writes: \"*Evidently there are a great many genes weakly correlated with prostate cancer, which can be combined in different combinations to give near-perfect predictions. This is an advantage if prediction is the only goal, but a disadvantage as far as attribution is concerned. Traditional methods of attribution operate differently, striving as in Table 1 to identify a small set of causal covariates (even if strict causality cannot be inferred)*\". Which translated means it would be more difficult to explain to regulators why they should trust results from these models, since they care more about attribution than prediction (see hero_pup and relevantmeemayhere answers).

* Significant skepticism among scientists exists on personalized medicine. Not an expert on this, but the experts whose judgment I value, have spoken less than positively about it. 

With that being said, we are seeing areas where AI approaches seem to bring some value such as diagnostic imaging, even though there are still significant challenges ahead. Patient recruitment could be another area. And who knows, LLMs may help in expediting some of the more regulatory work, kinda like we use LLM as personal assistant today."	"9"

I don't know if smart metering in its original sense ever became a thing in many locations. As far as I know, the original thought behind smart metering was that the meter should control the behaviour of the devices consuming the power behind the meter. 

But I think that part of smart metering has been left in the dust by a new reality where most of the power hungry devices are being connected to the internet individually and are being controlled by other means, for example a price signal. So the role of the \"smart meter\" today is mostly to provide the necessary data for hourly billing at variable prices.

I think the Danish datasets have some potential for exploring the behavioural effects of smart metering, as in \"variable electricity price\". I don't know if it was something like that, you had in mind?

To explain this in more detail:

In Denmark, all household electricity meters are logging consumption on a 15 or 60 minute basis. The last meters without this capability were replaced in 2020. In my own household, I can see hourly data back to 2014.

Until 2020, those data went almost unused. Almost all costumers paid the same price per kWh all day.

Around 2020, the country started changing towards variable transport tariffs. Those are non-voluntary, and solely depends on which grid company you are attached to, and what type of consumer you are (housholds and some different categories of business consumers). Today, 98-99% of all Danish households pay a variable transport tariff, divided into 2 or 3 fixed transport prices over each 24 hour period. The variability of this transport tariff is rather high, compared to the total electricity price. In my case, the difference between my transport tariff at night and in the afternoon is around 0.12 ¬/kWh. In other parts of the country, this difference is as high as 0.26 ¬/kWh. 

On top of this, a lot of consumers are on a power plan, where the price of electricity excluding transport and tax will follow the spot market price hour by hour. My guess is that somewhere between 50 and 75% of all consumers are on these plans. Over the last week, this part of my electricity price has varied between 0.00 and 0.18 ¬/kWh, and that was actually a period with stable prices. On some days we have negative prices in the cheapest hours, and on some days we have prices of 0.50 ¬/kWh in the most expensive hours. From memory, the absolute records during the last few years were around -0.50 ¬/kWh and 0.80 ¬/kWh.

The above numbers should be seen in the context of a total electricity price of around 0.20-0.30 ¬/kWh including transport and tariffs, when averaged over all hours in a month. So the total hourly variations in price actually exceed the total average price a lot of the time. And yes, we do have had hours, where our total electricity price was negative.

Because of all this, I think there may be a valid data science project in exploring how this change from a fixed price to variable prices has affected the consumption numbers. Is it possible to quantify how smart metering has moved consumption from expensive hours to cheap hours?

Reach out to old professors for guidance. If they remember you, youll be surprised at how willing there are to provide guidance. 

If that doesnt work then reach out to your school alumni on LinkedIn for mentorship (Ive done that so many times)

Search for mentorship programs. You can start with those specific to international students, your racial/ethnic  group, etc

After few searches online I realized how out of touch he was with the current trends and how naive that guy is to tell me that instead of saying he doesn't know. 

  
Another very famous Professor told me to take MCMC course as the industry is starting to realize the power of this approach. I did but I still haven't found a single job posting that asks of such knowledge but maybe such things are asked from seniors

  
I asked another Professor what I could study from statistics on my own during summer break and he told me that I can't study statistics on my own because it is very hard. I've been studying some statistical methods on my own for a while now and since I don't rush things I form my intuition better than when I studied at Uni

I asked another Professor how different is the approach to time series is compared to tabular data and at the end of the conversation I realized while he understands what transformations of data are he has no idea what the phrase \"feature engineering\" or even kaggle is.

So yeah I don't recommend asking Professors about the industry either. imo you should hit up people from the industry on linkedin or network in some other ways to get some decent advices.

It depends on the type of model you use and the nature of your time series data, and whether there is a data drift or not.

For your model, if it is a type of SEQ2SEQ model, then there is no need to retrain so often. ARIMA &amp; SARIMA will benefit from retraining after each new observation, assuming the observations are not anomalies.

One red flag I see however is that you have to first forecast your exogenous variables! Without not knowing what they are, one can't tell whether they are messing up your modeling and retraining accordingly. Are you even sure your exogenous variables count as independent variables in the context of your time series target? And wouldn't just a seasonal time series model capture the pattern without the need for exogenous variables? Those are the things I'd be examining first before being concerned about a model refreshment best practice."	"2"

Luis here, I work on Concrete ML so dont hesitate if you have any question about FHE + ML or more specifically Concrete ML.

Ideally an encryption algorithm converts to a space where everything looks like random noise, and imparting additional structure on that space corresponds to a weaker encryption. You need to minimize that structure if possible.


One potential policy, especially if youre trying to generate complex datasets for test cases without synthesizing it all by hand, is to start with a traditional encryption for the data at rest. Then when you need to create a test set, select off a small and minimal subset, decrypt it like you normally would, pass it through your homomorphic encryption with a single-use key, and discard the key without ever recording it. The idea is to prevent any single homomorphic dataset from being large enough for someone to find useful patterns and reverse the encryption, and it minimizes the blast radius if they do. Done correctly, it renders the original data irrecoverable, so the homomorphic copy is no longer quite so sensitive.


Itll also be important that details about your algorithm are privileged information that stays inside the company. You dont want people to know what structure youre preserving because that tells attackers what patterns to look for."	"4"

Some patterns might be preserved by the encryption, in which case an attacker might be able to make guesses about which subgroups are which. Domain knowledge about the original space can weaken the encryption significantly more than the arithmetic alone might indicate. This is another reason why I suggest minimizing the size of homomorphic datasets. It increases signal to noise ratios in the original data, so its less likely anything useful ends up in the homomorphic data."	"4_1"

Similar to how I advise people to NOT spend all your time in one piece of technology (e.g.: being the Oracle DBA guy), learning other domains is useful down the road if you find your domain is slow.

For one great example, I work in the video game industry. Our industry has seen massive layoffs last months. Roughly about 10,000 people lost their jobs. When I looked on LinkedIn at the time, there was maybe 400 jobs for the game industry on a generic search. Having that additional domain experience helps in situations like that so you can pivot until more roles open up down the road. This on top of the fact other industries can bring new ideas to the industry you love.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share my current situation and seek some advice from the community regarding my career and relocation plans.

Experience and Education:

Experience:

I have been working as a linguist for the past 6 years in the same position.

Education:

MSc in Computational Linguistics (2020)

BA in Literature (2015)

Both degrees are from reputable universities, although they are located outside the EU.

Current Situation:

I am 31 years old and have been feeling a bit uncertain about my current job. While it used to be satisfactory, I have noticed signs that my colleagues and I might be facing demotion. Consequently, I am considering transitioning to a new career. Some of my colleagues have successfully made the switch to data science, which has inspired me to pursue the same path.

I have some background in python and ML thanks to my MsC. At the beginning of 2024, I started learning machine learning algorithms. I have been studying regression, polynomial regression, SVM, k-means, and other relatively simple algorithms. To supplement this, I enrolled in Codecademy to refresh my Python skills. I have completed Python 3 and am currently working on finishing the elementary Python course. My plan is to continue learning and developing my skills in machine learning as a data scientist on this platform.

I don't have connections in the programming industry, which has made it challenging to secure job opportunities. I have applied to some positions on LinkedIn, but unfortunately, I have not received any responses. I have never participated in hackathons or Kaggle competitions, and my GitHub profile is relatively empty. Although I completed some basic projects on Codecademy, I don't believe they are noteworthy enough to showcase on GitHub.

Relocation and Career Options:

My company offers relocation opportunities, but the process is lengthy and uncertain. Recently, the HR department informed me that the relocation process has become more difficult, and approval is not guaranteed. This uncertainty leaves me in a dilemma. While I am eager to leave my current country, I am also determined to transition into a new career.

Options Considered:

Option 1: Apply for relocation and simultaneously work on becoming a data scientist. If I receive a job offer or sponsorship from an EU country, I will relocate and transition into a data science career. Otherwise, I may have to wait for the relocation process to conclude before pursuing a career change.

Option 2: Seek a data scientist job or internship locally to gain relevant experience and enhance my career prospects. I can then apply to EU-based positions, potentially increasing my chances of securing sponsorship.

Option 3: Apply for PhD or master's programs in Europe focused on data science. This path may offer a more guaranteed route to acquiring a work permit and starting a new career. However, it will require a longer time commitment, and there is uncertainty about acceptance due to my limited ties with academia in recent years.

I am seeking guidance and suggestions on the best course of action to achieve my career and relocation goals. Any feedback or insights from the community would be greatly appreciated.

I look forward to hearing from you."	"10"

I am a data scientist based in Canada and a bit confused with my career trajectory so decided to ask here just in case someone has some insightful advice for someone like me.  
  
Here's my background: I did my PhD in ECE from a reputed university in Canada around 7 years ago, not in \"AI\" (so no neurips/ icml etc publications) but with a solid base in statistics/ probability/ applied math. I worked in finance for several years, starting as a quant researcher and then getting into ML research/ data science for finance through which I got some solid experience. Was lead off a few months ago.  
  
My question is, what's the best thing I can do to get back to a more research-y math-oriented career trajectory either in the larger AI/ML space? Or has that ship sailed already?"	"12"

Ive applied to a few data scientist roles, and even with a referral, have been getting rejected by HR people who seem to think that Im making a huge career jump. Given the job market, its understandable to prefer someone whos worked as a DS at a tech company before, but I am a bit surprised that these HR people do not seem to even know what a financial quant is.

  
Anyway, a former colleague (from my pre-financial quant job) is hiring for a data science job. Shes the hiring manager, but has no technical background. We had a great feeler call, and she seems to want to work togetherthough she will be relying on her more tech savvy colleagues to test my ability.

  
On Monday, I have a screener call with the HR person, and Im afraid that hell see my experience as a quant and want to reject me since I dont have a previous role with the exact title data scientist.

  
How do you all think I should communicate my experience as a financial quant? How do I convince someone whos only worked in tech all their life that financial quant is relevant to DS?"	"13"

You should develop a simple elevator pitch to explain why your background is a good fit.

I agree with another poster that you should emphasize your programming experience while downplaying your specific R experience. I have a similar skillset; I'm a very good R programmer (spend 30-40 hours coding it a week) who understands CS and software engineering. Many people who don't know R assume it's not a \"training wheels programming language\" like Stata or JMP. It's frustrating for people who are genuinely good R programmers to downplay that skillset, but it's part of the interviewing game."	"13_2_1_1"

I've recently submitted my PhD in the UK which looked at applications of unsupervised learning to cyber security issues and the security of the algorithms themselves with some publications. I am now looking to transition into industry as a data scientist.   


During my PhD and BSc (Computer Science) I have extensively used python, sql, stats, and ml stuff, and during my studies had three internships. One was as a software developer at an analytics company nearly a decade ago and the other two were as a security consultant, however, both were spent researching ML applications within security.  Ive been applying to a bunch of DS roles over the past 3 months, but with zero interest. It's not the longest time but have been wondering what I can change or add in my approach and/or expectations. 

1) Does my security focus come across as too far removed from data science? In my cv and cover letters, I explain my experiences with SQl, analysis, stats, ml etc. and that security has mainly been the problem area as opposed for the work as opposed to the focus in itself, but on a quick glance of degree or job title headers t clearly screams a security focus.  


2) With this in mind, should I stay true and keep pursuing DS roles, or am I simply not qualified?

3) If 2 is true, what would the best course of action be? I have applied to a few DS summer internships in the hope of adding to my employability and the potential for a job on completion. Obviously, the pay will not be fantastic and how much impact would an internship have on my employability versus applying to data analyst roles and looking to transition after a year or two?  


99% of the people in my network are either academics or software engineers so would appreciate some insight!"	"14"

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I have a personal project I've been working on that I'm sure could be automated and optimized, yet I have no knowledge on databases.

Let's say I have a group of 40 students. They each have a set of characteristics, for instance 10 different colors of shoes, and a score from 1 to 20. I want to sort them into 10 different groups of 4, where in each group no student shares a characteristic with any other (they all have different color shoes) and the average score of all the students in each group is as close as possible to the average score of all students combined as possible. So the priority is not sharing characteristics, but after that evening out the score average among all groups is what I want to optimize.

Offer 1: F500 Defense Contractor  
Title: Data Scientist InternPay: $25/hr  
Format: 100% onsite, 40 hrs/week  
Details: Intern on the data science team in one of their R&amp;D centers. Opportunity to do some cool stuff with ai/machine learning to improve manufacturing processes, seems like they would give me flexibility based on what I would like to work on. Data science team across the company is growing and there is definitely some opportunity to convert to full time. Plus I'm local to the area

Offer 2: Local Bank  
Title: Data Engineer Intern  
Pay: $18/hr  
Format: 100% remote (meet on site once a month), 20 hrs/week  
Details: Didn't think I'd get this one tbh, wasn't really confident during the interview. Intern on the BI team supporting the analysts, would involve data storage/warehousing, data pipelining/ETL. Data team is pretty young, I would literally be the only data engineer on the team so I have no idea who i'd turn to if I had questions. This kinda feels like they're throwing the intern to the fire.

On paper the choice is pretty obvious, but the reason I'm mulling this over is because I've had previous data science internships and I've been wanting to get more into the software/engineering side of data and analytics. I'm not sure how much of that work I'd be doing during the data science internship. Ideally I would do both but they both have around the same start date and last during the summer. Maybe I could ask if the bank could take me on part-time during the fall. Thanks for the advice"	"16"

I am in college, currently in biology, graduating in the fall, and I wanted to get some type of degree in data science as another option for a career to go into (both my parents have been in CS/DS their entire lives).  Ignoring the biology degree, I have a few questions: 

First: what would be considered the most valuable to an employer?  Would a type of Certificate in DS, a Bachelors in DS, or a Masters in DS be the most valuable? I've been told a Bachelors but I wanted some input.

Second: for any of these options are there any reputable online schools or classes that I can accomplish this goal with?  My current school would require at least 3 more years to get a bachelors in DS and I'm looking for quicker/more affordable options that are still credible (any options/suggestions would work!).  

Lastly: I'm a bit worried about spending too much extra time in college especially because I have no experience in DS (I've only dabbled surface level into most coding languages) and not much job experience either, I do have a good deal of excel proficiency but I'm not if that is helpful.  Does anyone have any suggestions for possible internships or any advice on the matter?

My company (15 person startup, 5 person engineering team) is trying to dip its toes into some data science heavy features without having any actual data scientists on the team. I have somehow become the de-facto data person at my company which is frightening because I have absolutely no idea what Im doing.

What I do have is a B.S. with a dual major in computer science and computational mathematics, which included two data science courses in undergrad. But undergrad was a long time ago.

But I dont want to become a full time data scientist, I am happy as a software engineer and Id like to learn enough to fill the gaps at my company until we are ready to hire an actual data scientist. And besides the job aspect, Ive always been interested in data science and Id like to learn it.

Im thinking of asking my company to pay for me to take a data science course or do a certificate program, and I think they would be amenable to the idea. But Im wondering if I will really learn enough from just one course or a couple courses for a certificate for it to be worth my time, even if its not my money.

Am I being naive about how much useful knowledge I can gain in a single course or a few courses? Should I just stay in my lane as a software engineer, or is there value in trying to do both? And if it is doable, whats the best way to do it? Can anyone recommend any specific courses or certificates?

P.S. I really dont think I can self-teach which is why Im looking for graded courses or programs. I have ADHD and I need the deadlines / tests / grades as a motivator or Im just going to abandon it. I wish I wouldnt, but I know myself well enough to know that I would."	"29"

Fast forward a few years and I can do reports and dashboards in Power BI and write some decent DAX stuff, use Google BigQuery and write some easier to moderate SQL, some basic Python, use AI to help figure things out and deploy code, and moderately advanced Excel/Google Sheets. Work example, last year one of my projects was to build a labor model for our company's manufacturing production and I combined data from our MRP, sales data, labor time trials, and other things to build a model in BigQuery that pipes into Google Sheets that would predict our weekly FTE need in various departments split out by different stations and skills, and make it super easy to read and simple to input current day's FTE count and get a good idea what we could produce. The reason for GSheets is because we use Google a lot and we needed many people to be able to access it easily, but I digress... This project was wildly successful, and predicted our FTE needs wonderfully, and really gave our production leads insight into how to juggle people around to balance production flow.

I'm a CS grad looking at either MSc Data Science or MSc Stats and don't know which one to go for.  
  
Looking at a lot of the MSc Stats courses in the UK, it looks way too mathematical for a CS grad since I didn't learn that much pure maths in my course. We barely went past basic imaginary numbers, partial deviates, basic matrices, ODEs, etc and didn't really learn much stats except probability for AI and discrete maths as well as just normal distribution. Most our Maths was discrete e.g. Graph Theory, Set Theory, Computational Complexity, etc.  
  
There's a few data science courses (UCL, LSE, Nottingham, Bath, etc) around which are very applied stats heavy (can be up 60-80% stats and are taught by either stats dept or joint maths&amp;cs dept) but either restrict modules CS grads can take or have like Stats for Data Science, Experiment Design, Applied Statistics, Statistical NLP, Time Series, etc vs Statistical Theory, Stochastic Analysis, etc in a Stats MSc.

I take you weren't working as a nurse or something then as you'd be making the same, if not more than you are right now. If you want to raise your salary/ability to buy a home in the US you can:

1. move to a city that pays analysts more without exorbitant housing prices (you'd be looking at midwest cities like Chicago, St. Louis or in the South/Rust Belt like Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Houston). Think MCOL. 
2. get a job that pays more in Boise
3. get a remote job that pays more. This may be harder than the first two suggestions. 
4. Find a spouse that will help contribute financially. If you're responsible for multiple children on a single income you'll have trouble buying a house anywhere without a significantly higher salary. Maybe move in with the grandparents?
5. don't go into debt for this, but you can also look at the gatech omsa program for a masters degree. This can help with getting past HR filters, but it won't be a guaranteed wage bump."	"35_1_1_1"

For stochastic processes, you may start with Pinsky and Karlin [very easy even if you don't have a good probability background] but Cinlar's books are probaby better.

PhD student at UChicago astrophysics. I genuinely love doing research and love my discipline a lot, but for personal life reasons, I am considering transitioning to industry down the line. 

I aim to intern for a data science research role in Summer '26 and convert that to a full-time offer. Relocating to the Bay Area would be ideal. I don't necessarily care a ton about company name/ prestige/ pay as long they are reasonable; willing to work hard to move up the ladder. 

I know it's a couple years away, but I'd like to start early. Some background info -  

1. Computer Science - I have extensive programming experience in Python (scripting/ Jupyter). Have about six research projects that I've programmed entirely by myself. My PhD thesis work is neatly contained into libraries under version control. I took OOP in C++/ Algorithms and Time Complexity (proof-based) and did quite well in those CS classes. Have experience with parallelization through research projects. Also have working knowledge of bash commands etc.

2. Statistics - I deal with noisy data from telescopes all the time, and compare measurements with observables predicted from simulations I run. Common techniques I interact daily with are parameter fitting using MCMC, regression with uncertain/ censored data, hypothesis testing, PCA. I have done a few short-term projects combining ML with astronomy/ biophysics, so I have a working knowledge of ML (MLP, CNNs, Gaussian Processes), but not cutting-edge. 

3. Math - well-versed with linear algebra, differential equations/ PDEs, multivariate calculus, discrete math.

4. Project Management - I led satellite operations for a NASA based mission for three years during undergrad, developed infrastructure for the mission and oversaw/ trained three generations of operations.

5. Writing/ communication - am currently working on at least two first-author publications. Have TA'd undergraduate STEM courses for four academic quarters.

I know there's a lot I need to polish/ learn to be competitive for roles given the current market, but I was hoping somebody could point out helpful things to focus on for prep. I've started doing Kaggle for instance and plan on participating in the Citadel Datathon this coming Fall - would these be helpful pursuits? I am aware that my knowledge of version control/ SWE stack is currently laughable, so I'd need to polish those a lot more.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I apologize in advance for my naivete, I have never had an industry job and have always been part of the academic pipeline, so I'm very new to this. I am coming here because my research online has not yielded coherent advice for somebody in my position (i.e. a PhD student) concerning what kind of roles I should aim for/ what I should focus on for my prep."

hi, im currently a 3rd year electrical and electronic engineering bachelors student, and i have a strong interest in data science/business intelligence. i have alot of experience in devOps (2 internships and some personal projects) so coding \"logic\" isnt an issue. My final year project in school that I chose to do is going to be on business intelligence, but im still unsure of what exactly i will be doing as the professor has yet to brief me on more details.

I did a project on Machine Learning as well, and i think some relevant \"skillsets\" i have are MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Plotly, Eli5, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Pyplot, Sklearn, Tensorflow, OpenCV.

I was wondering if it would be possible/sensible for me to fully pursue a career in this field with my current background, and what can I do to increase my chances of securing a job in the role? I am not sure how to move forward from here and was hoping for some advice.

Not just data engineering or data science. The best way to learn cloud computing - by doing it. For example, transfer your small-scale projects and optimize the cost as much as possible. By doing so you will learn a valuable lesson - not just accuracy but a combination of accuracy, speed, and cost matters. That's what Kaggle competitions lack.

Certification matters only if you want to test and showcase your skills in the interview with HR (not data experts). Nevertheless, your personal project will show real skills better than a document with your name. So  transfer local projects from the local to the cloud environment, optimize everything you can, and parallelly get certifications by this path (AWS): Cloud Practioneer -&gt; Solutions Architect Associate

I work as a data scientist at a megabank. The pay is pretty good, the benefits are really good and the work life balance is absurdly good (seriously, some days I work for like half an hour).

I'm worried that I'm just going to drift completely out of touch with the bleeding edge of the market and that the longer I stay in the company, the more behind I'll be when I finally leave.

On the other hand, the average tech company is likely to have the same/more salary, worse benefits and much worse work life balance. Just from a financial/life perspective, it's a very compelling argument to stay in this company - and indeed many people here have been here for decades.

Can anyone with more experience critique my current plan?

I currently am working as an entry level RD scientist for a medium size pharmaceutical company. I have a BS in biomedical engineering. The current skills i have are I know enough python html, sql, css and Java script to deconstruct, rebuild, create most programs. I can plan, create, and document scientific studies. Math wise Im comfortable with basic algebra but my calculus needs a refresher and I am not very comfortable with linear algebra or differential equations. Im working through some Coursera data science math courses to fix this.

In my work I started off as just a bench top scientist then worked my way into a project team. I then decided I wanted to add some data centric skills since I am pretty competent with computers and my company has been pushing scientists to get more data analytic skills. I wanted to see if I liked that type of work so sought out people in my department who did that work. I started working with our departments dashboard guy to learn how they made and setup our dashboards. I liked what we did and the thinking we had to do to solve data problems was fun. Unfortunately they got promoted out of the department before the finished teaching me and the dashboards ownership was up in the air since nobody had been lined up to takeover the responsibility. At the same time the dashboards they made broke. Which is were my plan starts from.

My plan:


1. Take over responsibility for the dashboarding of my department. Which gives me a connection to our departments data scientist. 
2. Fix the issues with the broken dashboards 
3. Create better dashboards since I have the understanding of how users wants to see their data presented 
4. Put together a small team of junior scientists that have an interest in dashboarding and teach them enough to be effective at making and maintaining dashboards. So we have a pool of people to pull from for bigger projects. 
5.  Complete the bigger projects that the previous person didnt get to with my team.
6. Join a modeling project within my department while relearning/learning the math on off hours
7. Use my previous work as justification to get tuition reimbursement for a masters in Data science 
8. Complete my masters and move into a data scientist role within the same company or have another company pay back the debt I would owe by leaving early. 

So far I just started step 6 and step 7 seems to be a go all I have to do is find a program. Does what I am doing make sense? Im I missing steps or I am i moving in the wrong direction? Is there more I could be doing to improve my marketability? Is there specific math concepts I can focus on to prep for the masters?"	"21"

I've been navigating this challenging job market for a couple of months now and am seeking advice or insights on refining my job search strategy. Despite applying to nearly 140 positions since December, my success rate has been low, with only 3 screening calls and no solid offers yet.

**Background:**

* **Experience:** Nearly 3 years as a Data Scientist at a large automotive company where I worked on a near daily basis with Python, Spark, and HiveQL. I did *some* ML stuff such as categorical clustering (behavioral attributes for marketing audiences), decision tree classifier (used for root cause analysis on engine malfunction using diagnostic codes), and some other more statistical stuff (i.e. anomaly detection on important data pipelines going to other companies/orgs).
* **Education:** Recently completed MSc in a computational science type program abroad (in Germany but now back in the US), including a thesis project training and optimizing an NN classifier.
* **Current Strategy:** Applying to jobs via LinkedIn with tailored T-style cover letters for positions allowing it.

**Considerations:**

* **Cloud Computing:** Lacking experience in this area - my company had/rented their own HPC with Hadoop and was only just beginning a transition to GCP when I left - so I'm contemplating earning an AWS Solutions Architect certification or something similar.
* **Side Project:** Considering starting a project involving AWS, NLP, and automation to showcase my skills. It's something with a real use-case and not just some Kaggle project and so while it's not perfectly tailored to what I might need it is a little more authentic.

**Questions:**

1. Should I prioritize gaining specific skills like cloud computing over increasing my application volume?
2. Would a focused side project potentially make me a more attractive candidate?
3. Any other strategies or adjustments you'd recommend based on your experiences?

I appreciate any advice or shared experiences that could help steer my approach in a more fruitful direction. Thanks!"	"22"

I'm planning to continue working full-time, so the options I'm assessing are mostly part-time and online programs. The fields I'm looking at are data analytics, data science, data engineering, and bioinformatics. Here are some of the programs I'm considering:  
  
\- Harvard Extension School - Data Science  
\- Northeastern University x Coursera - Data Analytics Engineering  
\- BU Metropolitan College - Health Informatics  
\- Brandeis (online) - Bioinformatics  
\- Johns Hopkins University (online) - Bioinformatics or Data Science  
  
My questions are:  
  
1. In terms of respect from employers (or \"prestige\" I guess), how does Harvard Extension School compare to a non-extension school from a \"lesser\" university? I've had some people say the Harvard name beats all (extension or not), and others who say it's better to get a degree somewhere else that doesn't have a built-in debuff.  
  
2. Does anybody know anything about these programs or other similar programs and have knowledge/opinions/experience of any of them?  
  
3. Any suggestions for similar programs?"	"31"

If you want to go straight into AI/ML without creating algos from scratch I'd recommend their OSMA program. GT is also a top 10 school. I was also looking at Arizona Uni for Bioinformatics. They have a degree that uses Python and Bio together. 

Personally, I've looked into Eastern University, but not sure how good that is. 
Good luck!"	"31_1"

I didn't know about Georgia Tech's online programs, and $9900 for an entire Master's is a hell of a deal. Does the \"Online\" in OMSCS or OMSA show up on your diploma or degree?

Also, how would you rate the difficulty of the Georgia Tech program? Some people are saying Georgia Tech is brutal, but they're mainly talking about undergrad. I'd assume grad is even harder in most cases."	"31_1_1"

The online does not appear on the diploma from what I understand. 


I'm in my first semester and taking a \"medium\" level course just to get me back into the groove of things for school. I'm taking an AI course right now. I would say choose your classes (if you go CS route) carefully, you could get an \"easy\" CS Master's and only take one or two harder courses. I would say for someone who works 40 hours a week it can difficult to find time to the do the work. Currently every week there is some sort of code, writing assignment, and peer feedbacks due. 
OSMA has more business classes like management of IT and stuff like that. But OMSCS and OSMA share a lot of the classes (OMSCS has a machine learning or iteractive intelligence specialization. I'm doing the interactive one since I don't have to take an algorithms course). One other difference is in OSMA you have to do an internship or implement what you learned in the program in a work related project (which is why OSMA is more expensive). For OMSCS you just take the 10 courses and you graduate, although they do have a course you can take where you publish a paper. 


 
It depends mainly on what courses you are interested in tbh. I have interest in NLP, ML, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning which the last 3 are some of the harder courses at GT since they go very indepth. 

I chose OMSCS because I like the computer science name (more broad if unable to get a DS job) but I am thinking about going to a diff school. In my opinion, I feel like they fluff up some of the courses for busy work.

A basic Data Analyst focused on reporting, dashboards, etc - basic arithmetic. Addition (sum), division (average, percent, rate), etc. Also descriptive stats - count, mean, median, min, max, quartiles, standard deviation. 

Advanced Data Analyst or Analytics Data Scientist - all of the above plus experimentation/hypothesis testing - sample size, confidence intervals, p-value, t or z tests, etc. Also basic probability. Plus some predictive modeling - linear/logistic regression, clustering models, neighborhood models, tree based models (random forest/xgboost). You dont need to code them from scratch but you need to understand how they work and how to evaluate them. 

Machine Learning Eng or Research Scientist  - All of the above and Ill defer to someone else for the specifics but youre also starting to get into linear algebra (matrix multiplication), calculus (derivatives), geometry (distance measures).

It depends where you are looking, and how competitive (and possibly how well compensated) the role is. If you look at really big tech companies, for the more technical DS roles, many people have PhD / MS. Probably the same for hedge funds.

If you're looking at a data analyst job at a traditional company or government, then probably a BS?

What is \"required\" ultimately is some combination of technical skill. Depending on role and what they are looking for, it's possible that you do need effectively PhD level ability, though those roles are rare.

The successful_completion time is fixed and predetermined. It cannot change (outside of hitting bad_event) first.  

Think like, a human will have a 65th birthday, unless they die first. So Im trying to, essentially, predict if/when they might die. Except its not human death in my problem. So, I dont really care about predicting when the 65th birthday will happen. It will happen on year 65 for everyone. But I am concerned with their survival up to that point.

I can see how these may compete, but controlling for the successful_completion is what I havent gotten to in my readings yet (looking to cheat the learning process here I guess).

I am a professor writing a letter or recommendation for a student. These are the strengths of this student. 1), 2), & Can you writing an initial draft of a letter of recommendation I can build upon?

[ChatGPT writes a draft]

[You edit it and add more text/detail as needed]

Here is the text I came up with, can you polish the text to make it better

Example 2:

I am a data scientist that specializes in X responding to a question of Y. I need to provide a detailed reply to this question asked in an email. [Provide those details]. Could you draft an easy to read response to this email please?

[ChatGPT provides a draft]

[You revise, correct and add detail]

Here is what I built up on your response, can you help proof and finalize this email response please?

Both of these are excellent examples where ChatGPT does the grunt work, while you are doing the intellectual work. Both save massive amounts of time, especially in the proof reading stage.

The key thing is that you need to prompt ChatGPT as to its role in writing. Generally, ChatGPT struggles with facts and details, while it excels at structuring writing very well. If you provide the details, it can do the hard part of structuring your details into a much easier to read format. If you edit what it provides, it gets even better.

Note, this assumes a paid ChatGPT account. The free accounts seem to have major limits in doing these tasks effectively.

Both of these highlight tasks that need to be done well, but take a LOT of time todo. Working with ChatGPT saves time in developing *effective* communication.

Also, this is for Dept heads, but if you can code in Python, you can automate these tasks so you dont need to copy/paste text."	"3"

Moreover, VSCode offers the comprehensive features of an IDE, including syntax highlighting, debug mode, and interactive warnings, linters etc. enhancing your coding efficiency and experience. While preferences vary, for someone with experience, the advantages of using a full-fledged IDE with the appropriate extensions seem clear.

Your model has to be driven by hypothesis of stakeholders. Attrition is different at every firm but usually key stakeholders will have a good idea as to why people leave. Accessing exit interview data also helps.

For example at one of my clients, a lot of people mentioned the lack of a career ladder. So we added a variable to track tenure in current role, and saw that once someone spent 2+ years in their role, their attrition likelihood would skyrocket. Indicating people already know at that point they will be stalling in their careers.

But this will vary company by company and its your job as a DS to parse our the key information from the stakeholders.

Time series models to predict attrition rarely work. Weve had the most success with CATBoost (since youre likely going to be dealing with a lot of categorical variables) and survival analysis.

It also depends on how many employees there are. Unless you have 5k+ employees YoY, you might want to stay away from doing ML.

Edit: one thing I forgot to mention is that you also sometimes need to split by job type, or business unit, since dynamics will greatly vary across thise"	"1"

And a lot of the most powerful features will be categorical. Tree-based methods likely good, catboost sounds good.

A lot of the features OP will want will be super-highly-incredibly sensitive (e.g. are they going to give you performance review data? because that's very likely predictive), others will not be tracked (e.g. amount of direct interaction with manager and higher management is likely predictive, but not tracked). So discovery will be important.

To OP's need, for forecasting future attrition rates, as long as it is not super far in future (and super far in future, likely will not be accurate anyway), just do it based on aggregation across individual-level probabilities. If you know person A is 5% likely to leave in 3 months, person B 8%, person C 2%, that will give what you want, or close enough that with some transformation you can get there.

Also very important to understand is if the goal is simply to predict attrition or understand what is driving attrition. (in the end state, do higher-ups want to understand the causal drivers?

You are trying to do something typically called causal inference. You want to understand how changes to variable X (deaths) will cause an effect on the variable Y (outcome of match).

But you can't really do that with observational data with the method you're proposing because you didn't get to control for and randomize the X variable!

At best, the SHAP value will help to tell you about the correlation between your variable and your target.

Think of it like this: Imagine you are building a model to predict who is going to survive in a hospital and you give it variables like a person's age and gender and whether they are currently in intensive care or not.

After you train this model to predict who's likely to die, you might look at the shap graph for the feature \"is patient in ICU\" and you might see that going into the ICU actually increases your chances of dying! Which is strange, because why are we sending people to the ICU in the first place if it makes them worse?

The answer is that the ICU doesn't cause people to be more likely to die. It's just that the really sick people go to the ICU, so the model will simply learn the predictive correlation pattern that being in the ICU means a higher probability of dying soon because of unknown confounding factors.

So if you get at what I'm saying, that's why analyzing SHAP graphs for models trained on observational uncontrolled data is not likely to be very useful or insightful in the ways you would like it to be.

EDIT: For clarification, you can perform causal inference on observational data but not by training an ML model on it and observing the SHAP graphs. It's an entirely different process where you need put all assumptions into a graph of causality and control for all possible confounders. I suggest The Book of Why for more info"	"1"

Take your ICU example. If I invent the concept of the ICU and then randomly assign patients to it, I'll get the effect of ICU on patient chances of dying and find it to reduce the death rate.

If I use an existing ICU and measure the effect of X on Y then I'll find it increases deaths like you say. However, I know enough about healthcare to be aware of the confounder of sickness.

You can do casual inference on observational data, you just need to have a strong belief you've collected the data you need to control for all confounders. That's a big assumption which is why RCTs are the gold standard but OP may well have measured all confounders."	"1_1"

This is only true if you perfectly control for ALL known and unknown confounders.

This would mean you have to measure ALL types of sicknesses and degrees and ensure there is not a single variable missing that could be a confounder, etc.

I'd suggest \"The Book of Why\" for a further background.

You can't just control for all other variables and call it a day.

Also to clarify, my comment was talking about using SHAP graphs of an ML model trained on observational data to infer causal relationships. That's not really possible as far as I'm aware. You can drop the SHAP/ML part and try to use other methods by controlling for all confounders.

But again, the problem is that you can't just control for all variables. You need to control for the PERFECT exact set of correct confounding factors.

If you accidentally control for a non-confounder then that would invalidate the results entirely. Which funnily makes causal inferencebon observational data kind of a chicken or egg problem: You need to assume all of the confounders and causal relationships in order to even be able to infer causality. So you often end up with \"results\" that you can't validate for correctness and you just have to hope it's correct lol.

TL;DR: You can perform causal inference on observational data but I wouldn't recommend it because it rarely works well in practice and is extremely difficult to validate or confirm its correctness. Especially for somebody like OP who seems new to DS in general."	"1_1_1"

Firstly, you can control for non-confounding variables, it's actually useful to do so. I think what you mean is that controlling for causal descendants of your treatment will invalidate your results. This is true but markedly less of an issue than it would be if controlling for any non-confounding variable was a problem.

Secondly, you can't use SHAP but you canuse asymmetric Shapley values for this kind of analysis.


Finally, you mentioned in your other comment that this is all impossible to verify so who would use it. I agree that it's unverified but in practice this is often still useful because:

- Obtaining RCT validation data is cheaper than obtaining training and validation data if you must verify it

&gt;- Obtaining RCT validation data is cheaper than obtaining training and validation data if you must verify it 

Totally agree! I would be super happy if somebody was going to run causal inference on an observational dataset and only planned to use it after validating with a set of RCT validation data.

The problem I was pointing out is that 99% of people that try to use causal inference never do that imo. That's just my experience.

I rarely see people who run CI on observational data that later actually validate the results with an RCT. But if that's the actual plan then I totally support it!

&gt; - Data science is often about making better adverts or whatever. The risk is way less than drug trials where RCTs are a must and as a result a half decent causal model is usually worth trying out. It's usually better than no model!

I definitely agree in some respect! DS problems are not often as life or death as medical trials.

However, I'm not sure if I agree that it's usually better than no model.

If you plan to run CI on observational data and not validate it with any RCT, then I would disagree.

Again, I think it's like training a model with only a training set and never using any validation or test set. Maybe it's a good model, or maybe it's a horribly bad model.

I wouldn't necessarily say any model is better than no model.

In my experience, when people run CI on observational data, they are just trying to gather insights that will justify the pre-determined business strategy. Execs will just use the information that confirms the strategy they already wanted to go with.

So for all those reasons, I think running CI on observational data without any RCT for validation is a big waste of time in 99% of cases. It doesn't provide any value or new actionable information.

But those are just my thoughts and experiences and how I think people tend to use them in practice. But thanks for sharing your perspective, gave me more to think about :)"	"1_1_1_1_1"

Totally agree with this and it was a mix up of terminology on my part.

However, the problem still remains that you need to understand all causal descendants of your treatment.

So in OP's case, they cannot control for any causal descendants of \"in game deaths\". But how could OP even do that? I would bet that almost every feature in their dataset is a causal descendant of in game deaths during the match.

See what I'm getting at? I'm sure there are some cases in real life where the causal graph is simple and straight forward.

But for most real life problems, it's horribly complex AND unknown to begin with so the best we can do is make rough assumptions and hope for the best. Which I think often leads to \"insights\" that are just fodder for justifying upper management's predetermined business strategies."	"1_1_1_1_2"

First off, splitting groups into ICU and non-ICU wouldn't fix anything. 

The question OP was asking is if the variable \"is in ICU\" (or player deaths in op's case)  has a causal impact on the target and if so what kind of causal relationship it has.

How would splitting by ICU and analyzing OTHER features shap graphs help at all?

Also at the end of the day, if you only have observational data, you have to make a lot of assumptions and create a causal graph and use that to infer. You can read \"The Book of Why\" if you are curious to learn more.

But even if you do all that, SHAP graphs will not help.

I'll repeat again, SHAP graphs are just a measure of conditional correlation between a feature and target conditioned on all other features.

The example was just to help show you that correlation is not the same thing as causation.

It has nothing to do with life or death situations, etc.

I'm just telling you that the SHAP graphs are completely meaningless on the dataset you are talking about.

You can analyze the SHAP graph for the deaths feature, and maybe it says it is \"good\" for winning the game or maybe it says it is \"bad\". But you have no idea if it's true or not! It could be the opposite in reality, and if you try to decrease deaths then it would actually worsen your chances of winning even though you thought it was the opposite!

It's not about 99% accuracy, it's about having 0% accuracy. You have no clue if the model is correct or not. You might as well just make a random guess and say \"close enough\" because it might randomly be correct.

It's basically a random guess, which is not insightful or useful. You are basically just looking at correlations and then making up stories of how it should be interpreted. It will not be helpful really IMO."	"1_2_1_1_1"

You can definitely perform some more traditional causal inference where you build a graph of causality where you assume all of the causal relationships and plug that into a model to compute causal inferences.

But one, that's very different and doesn't involve SHAP or ML models directly.

Second, there's lots of caveat and issues with that method. It's very prone to giving incorrect and misleading results if you don't have the exact correct set of assumptions. It also can be completely invalid if you aren't measuring all of the important confounding factors.

That's the biggest issue with causal inference. You basically need to know all of the possible confounding factors and observe and control for them.

But it's kind of like a chicken or egg problem. We want to run causal inference studies to understand the causal relationships. But we need to know the structure of the causal relationships first and input those as assumptions for the methods to work on observational data.

Not with people in the ICU, that's your treatment variable that you're trying to measure the effect of but you could segment your data by patient health status.

Grouping your patients by some measure of how catastrophically sick they are and then measuring effect of ICU on outcome within groups will find ICU helps.

The question is what variables affect your chances of winning the game and did you measure them all?

For example, I could imagine tiredness causing in game deaths and overall defeats. If you've measured that somehow then you could include it. If you haven't, you'll find more deaths make you more likely to lose but really some of that will just be because tiredness makes you more likely to die and to lose.

Me and my friends (all CS undergrads) are starting to learn data analysis. We plan to do some group projects that we think are interesting to learn the basics along the way. We all have programming background so I think this would be a good approach. As for experience in data analysis, all we have are some undergrad courses in statistics/probability and some math like linear algebra and calculus.

In the beginning, projects will be purely for satisfying our own curiosity and learning. I think, creating a website and posting results of some of our more interesting projects would be good to, just to have something in our portfolio and keep us motivated. Experiment with ML a little bit, since we are interested in that. Later on, though, we would like to transition to something that's not only interesting to us, but also useful to other people as well. Find some freelance work on Upwork and such platforms after we are confident and have some experience.

We don't plan to do this for money, at least for now. Doing such projects seem like a reward in itself, as we will have to learn and research some interesting topics. The most important part seems to be coming up with projects that we actually care about, but we are 4 curious guys, so I think we will manage on that front.I know that I am idealizing a lot here and things won't be as simple as I made them seem.

I took CS classes for OOP in C++/ Algorithms and Time Complexity (proof-based). Have experience with parallelization/ computing clusters/ SQL through research tasks.

2. Statistics - Extensive experience with Monte Carlo methods (particularly MCMC parameter fitting). Most of my work compares measurements from noisy telescope data against numerical models/ simulations I build to infer underlying parameters. Also comfortable with regression with uncertain/ censored data, hypothesis testing, PCA. Working knowledge of ML (MLPs, CMNs, GPs).

3. Math - well-versed with linear algebra, differential equations/ PDEs, multivariate calculus, discrete math

4. Project Management - I led satellite operations for a NASA based mission for three years, developed infrastructure for the mission and oversaw/ trained three generations of operations

5. Writing/ communication - am currently working on at least two first-author publications. Have TA'd undergraduate STEM courses for four academic quarters.

I graduated in June 2023 with a CompSci degree and have been looking for a job mostly in software engineering but have yet to find one due to the market and going to a pretty unknown university.

My university had a BS in Data Science that just started as I was graduating and I took some introductory courses in the major and enjoyed it more than I ever have with software development. I've always had a slight issue with modern software development languages and frameworks but I figured I was in too deep already.

But after 7 or 8 months of no job I'm curious on what the opinion here is on getting a Masters degree in Data Science. I'm currently taking a Sports Data Analytics course on coursera through University of Michigan and am about 1/3 through it and enjoy it more than I ever enjoyed any computer science course.

Knowing all this, is it generally better to seek out a masters due to job market? Or is it better to save money and find data science projects that interest me and create a portfolio to hopefully find a job? Also, if I do a masters is there certain topics to look for on the courses for job security or is it more personal opinion?

Past data analyst wondering what else to do from here. I have 1 YoE having worked in fintech, using SQL and Tableau daily and having some exposure to AWS infrastructure. I have multiple years of internships in analyst work, and hold a Masters in Statistics from a T5 along with a bachelors in computer and cognitive science (AI focus, but didn't learn much about generative since it's a new topic and I'm not sure if i'm interested or qualified for generative or modern AI work atm)

I just want to know what to do from here. This market is abysmal, would it be helpful to try to get certifications? I'm thinking of working on AWS SAA and Power BI Data Analyst certifications, just literally anything to put me over the hundreds of candidates. I'm literally doing part time work just advising students to get into college. I literally want to know what to do, I want to be back on the market and doing data work but no one wants to hire me. I've failed two final stage interviews in the past three interviews, one because of poor presentation skills (which of course wasn't emphasized, instead they just gave a vague as fuck project) and one because I didn't have domain expertise. I really, really want to know what to do from here. It's been six months since a lay off and am I just really supposed to just keep chugging along? This market feels absolutely devastating.

Edit - I'm sitting at around 300+ apps at the moment, based in the Bay Area and applying to data science and analyst roles primarily. Occasionally any MLE, SWE, or data engineering work that feels like something I'm interested in. Is it worth branching out?

You should prepare more for interviews. Do case study challenges available online and read recommendations on how people tackle analytics interviews.

The problem you are having is it is a down market and you only have one year of experience, so you can only interview for junior and entry-level jobs. Most of those are extremely competitive or being put on hold.

I'd recommend looking for part-time contract work with smaller businesses or startups. Anything to get experience on your resume.

It's difficult, and the information is broad, to say the least. We've covered so many different topics it's hard to keep track of everything, but it's fascinating nonetheless.

I'm interested in audio applications. Growing up, I was into recording audio and slowly got into audio engineering (applying filters, effects, etc.) for music. Recently, I've got into a research position at my University that deals with analyzing acoustic emissions of fruits to extract phenotypic characteristic trends. Unfortunately, I can't get much more detailed than this due to NDA, but my role mainly focuses on preprocessing recorded data, integrating information from multiple sources, and conducting exploratory data analysis to identify meaningful trends.

The nice part about this job is that it doesn't rely much domain knowledge on fruits or their biology, as I'm working with a PhD student who has expertise in that field. My main focus is on extracting knowledge from the sound itself.

I'd like to go to graduate school after I finish my undergrad. My goal is to expand this sort of knowledge by studying audio classifiers and extracting value from sound.

Do you think this is a realistic career path in the data science/engineering domain, specifically focusing on audio applications?

I am looking for information on transitioning from academia to industry and understanding what career options exist.

I recently completed a phd in the hard sciences but am quite burned out on academia and have no interest in continuing in the field my phd was in (there is only one other research group doing theoretical research in the same topic anyhow, and they are in a different country). I wish to pursue a career in industry but have found it difficult to answer recruiters' questions about my career plans, largely because I don't know what people outside of academia do. I have been expressing interest in data science and applied math.

I have a very strong background in math and programming (and this is evident on my resume), and have had short stints doing software engineering jobs. I have good intuition for statistics. I have no particular experience with machine learning / \"deep learning\" and have been steering clear of AI-related job openings (which cuts out like half of them these days....).

I have only the coarsest of understandings of the difference between data scientist / data analyst / data engineer / etc. I like doing pure research, especially applied math, but it seems such jobs are hard to come by outside of academia. The path of least resistance would be to go back to being a programmer (at least I know what a programmer does and I am good at it) but I'd rather something more fulfilling.

I am a CPA working in private industry (healthcare) accounting for 8 years, promoted each year until I burned out and left in November. I was working a lot with consultants on system implementations, integrations, and report writing projects, which is what got me interested in DS. I enrolled in DataCamp Data Engineer courses (75% complete) and plan on hopefully getting the certification in the next 2 months or so. This decision was a bit on a whim, but I've enjoyed learning. Now I feel like it's time to start figuring out what I can do with these new skills.

If I successfully complete the certification, with no other experience, is it reasonable to search for a $100k job?

How much value and opportunity does accounting/management background bring?

I prefer the problem-solving aspect of DS versus analytics. Is this relevant?

Are there absolute DOs and DON'Ts for finding a good gig in DS? (For example in Accounting, it's generally DO get your CPA; DON'T go to public unless you can work crazy hours during busy season.)

Other questions I have include- what's your role, and what does your day-to-day look like? Should I hire someone to job hunt for me (send out resumes, schedule interviews, etc)?

I suppose it's critical to mention that I'm not looking to trade one corporate grind for another.

I left a stable job of 5 years mainly because I needed a change and my company didnt have any promotions or transfers available to me. I felt stuck. It was a small company, and I was in a handful of quantitative analysts.

The job I took is at a major company, household name. The job listing sounded good. I stalked potential coworkers LinkedIn profiles. They all sounded solid.

My interviews went well. I did a tough case study in Python. Prepared good quality code with transferability in mind, expecting them to run it. Functionalized and optimized it. Parameterized it. Etc. Gave a presentation on the findings.

I got the offer, negotiated, took the job. I thought I was gonna have a lot of learning and catching up to do. But its been miserable.

I am by far the best Pythoner on the team. The job is in reality data finder. No one looks at anyone elses code&no peer reviews, no version control. The job is quantity, over quality meet deadlines at all cost, even if the data is completely wrong or misleading. I feel like I could make stuff up and they would rather me do that. And the most analytics I will ever do are percentages or totals.

I took a job to expand my horizons and advance my technical skills. And Im now Im trying to find a way to at least use the situation beyond lying on my resume, like my now coworkers did.

To answer your question, I used Glassdoor when evaluating the offer. No real red flags. I recently filtered for data jobs and reread the Glassdoor reviews. The reviews are overwhelmingly positive. A couple of negative ones that just came across as really grumpy people, and a couple that mentioned a a few of the issues Ive had but are super vague. So based on the vague nature weighted heavily positive I realized based on Glassdoor I couldnt have known. I feel like I probably should write a more detailed review just to have one out there for someone like me.

And yeah Ive been trying to look at it that way&an opportunity to introduce best practices etc. I got very quickly discouraged when I couldnt even get my teammates willing to get software updates so Im trying to figure out even tinier baby steps in the meanwhile.

I work as a data scientist for a public health focused group. Part of my role has been to bring new Machine Learning/AI technologies to the team. After a year in I am realizing that my management doesnt have many thoughts on what their outcome goals are. Historically, they are a reference/resource group that manages the big healthcare datasets acquisition/maintenance and supports the analytics of other groups that want to use these resources.

A lot of the projects that are completed are basic epi style studies (observational research, regressions for statistical inference).  I brought some ML projects to the group that technically meet the ML goal, but are still statistical inference focused. These were successful projects, but management seems underwhelmed by this approach. 

Managements goal seems to be that they want to create capacity for production ready ML models. But they dont actually have any problems creating a predictive model  would solve or the problems they have thought of actually dont make sense. For example they think it would be great to create a model for diagnostic prediction, without realizing that we have no scope to apply those models (anonymized patient data and no clinical setting to apply them) or they think that that a time series forecasting infectious disease trends, without realizing that since our data is scoped to anonymized clinical patient level that we actually are missing a lot of the data that would probably be useful to make a successful model (no GIS data and no hierarchical regional data). 

We did some NLP on clinical notes, but we are actually loosing the data set that has clinical notes, so that path is a dead end. I have been diving into time series analyses for like anomaly detection and I think I can see some benefits in that direction. I personally think that given the common types of questions that are presented to the group they would be nicely complimented by causal applications and more robust statistical models, but this direction wouldnt require any productionalization, so I think it will not meet the expectations of management.

Basically, management bought into the ML hype and started to build the infrastructure for ML/AI without stopping to think, does ML/AI solve the questions that make sense for us to ask.

So my questions to you all. 
1. Does anyone have thoughts on how to manage situations like these where the goal set by management is ML/AI without specific problems in mind to apply these tools. 
2. Does anyone have thoughts on ml/ai applications to the public health space they would recommend I look further into? Ideally, something that could be placed in production? I have been reviewing the literature on this, but I cant seem to find many good examples that meet the same scope of our group.

Which job to choose?

I'm about to graduate university soon and I currently have one job offer that I have accepted in a reputable tech MNC for a role that is kinda adjacent to what I'm studying but may not be super related (I studied Data Science, role is Pricing Analyst that is trying to incorporate more data driven solutions so they are looking for ppl with my background). Not sure if the role will be technical enough since I've experienced bait-and-switch before. I also don't know if I'll have a lot of technical guidance in the role since traditional Pricing Analysts usually have finance/business background. The company has good working culture and it is highly recognised internationally.

However, I'm having second thoughts because I'm currently having an internship with another reputable company (though smaller and less established internationally) where I may get a return offer. The thing is I enjoy the work here a lot because it is very related to what I'm studying (Data Science modelling role) and the work is very mentally stimulating to me. Culture of the company isn't the best (have to WFO) but I enjoy interacting with my colleagues enough to endure it. However, this company may also be more prone to layoffs than the first one.

Hypothetically, if I do have a return offer for the second company, which one should I choose if the salary and benefits are comparable for both companies? I know a bird in one hand is better than two in a bush but I can't stop thinking about this scenario as I really enjoy my work in the second company. But at the same time, I've built a great connection with the people in the first company so it'll make me very uncomfortable to renege on the signed offer."	"35"

I would take the work that interest you. Coming out of grad school back in the day, still wear onions cause its cool to me, I had a similar choice. I had an offer for a pricing analyst job where the work was mainly done in excel but at a large national company that paid very well.

The layoffs have impacted analytics/data science, specifically for those roles in the tech industry.

Unfortunately a lot of folks are finding that even entry level prefers an advanced degree and/or 1-2 years of experience. 

Id recommend being extremely open minded - apply to any job with data in the title as well as words like metrics measurement reporting business intelligence BI etc. Also consider taking *any* job at a company that has a data team and try to make a pivot after 1-2 years of learning the business.

I recently got a work permit. I have 10 yr gap after my education. 
Unfortunately I have no experience. I got married and moved to states.

I got in touch with few consultancies as well, but they ghosted me after training completion, I even cleared mock interviews with them. But they ghosted me when it came to job placement. 
All internship positions require enrollment in college which is too expensive for me, the cheapest I could find was a Associate in Science degree(data science and analytics) program in local community college for around 10k.

I'm in my late 20's with a Bachelor in Hummanities, currently working in Marketing for a tech company.

I like Marketing, but couldn't help but notice how data informs all major decissions in a company. I also work for a tech company, and I can see how data is such a huge industry, worth tapping into.

I've heard about data brokers recently, and I have been having thoughts about opening my own marketing/inteligence company someday, so I would need some sort of basic understanding of how to interpret data.
Furthermore, being able to analyze data and make informed decissions is a great trait for SEOs to have in general.

I also think it would match my  former Degree nicely, as it is in Antropology.

Now, for obvious reasons, deciding to go for a second Bachelors is not an easy decission, for multiple reasons:

1. Time Investment: It would take 3 years to complete and 2 years to consolidate practical experience.

2.  Age: There is a bit of an ego battle, since most of my course mates would be much younger than me, plus the fact that many will start questioning such a choice . To this, add the fact that most people my age are at different stages in their lives...so yes doing a degree now feels even more challenging, even if I know that shouldnt be the case.

3. Money: I live in Europe, so I would be able to follow a Bachelors for free, or for significantly cheaper than in the US.
Still, there are all the other living costs that would add up, plus the fact that I would only be able to work part-time.

4. Work Experience: I have been trying to research what I need, starting from several job descriptions for this role. Most, if not all of them asked for hands-on experience, so the entry seems really competitive, and not all Masters are being built equal.

Conversely, if I were to go for the certificate &amp; self-taught route, It wouldn't be as straight forward, but it would be faster, cheaper, and would go straight to the point.

P.S: I have also researched for Masters in the field, but for someone with a non-technical background such as myself, I found the contents to be less technical, and less hands on. I suppose that this would work on the idea of \"enhancing \" my formal education, and less about becoming a Data Analyst per se, hence the idea of doing a Bachelors instead of a Masters because realistically, that would be just a year longer.

Both due to time commitment (less random stuff you need to do to meet degree requirements), as well as looking better on a resume. 

You can do credentials for your own learning purpose, but they generally have little value on a resume.

I really don't understand the idea that the masters is less technical. You need to choose the right program, but there are plenty of masters programs that should be more technical than bachelors degrees."	"4_1"

Greetings!

As the title said, i am looking to transition into DA/DS. To give a bit of background, I have a bachelors and msc in mechanical engineer from which I graduated 8 months ago. Unfortunately, I've realised a bit to late how wercked the job market for mech engineers is in my area, so I decided to invest the following 4 months to study (self learning basically) and train during my free time to transition into DS and hopefuly land a job as a junior at the end of it. I specially would like to gear towards business decissions and product management.

Now my question is: how would you recommend me to do so? I have 20 to 25h a week of free time to dedicate to this. I have quite a bit of experience coding already (I've worked a lot with python, know how to code websites with javascript and react). I also took some subjects about statistics and Design of Experiments in my bachelors (and actualy got pretty good grades in them).

Considering I am not \"starting from zero\" how whould you tackle this? What resources, online certifications books I should consume to make it? What coding lenguages should I learn? Any recommended udemy or coursera courses? Etc.. please I would like to know your thoughts and experience!!

Thanks a lot!!!"	"9"

I've been navigating my career in data science now for the past 5 years, starting with computational biology/genomics research, where I was deeply engaged with statistical modeling techniques, now to consulting, focusing on data risk &amp; privacy. Originally I was PhD track with a passion for genomics, but the reality of the financial situation I would be in changed my mind  thus moving to consulting for the money and experience in a variety of industries.

Although I've learned a lot about business and business technologies, my current position has moved me away from the hands-on statistical analysis and modeling, which I am passionate about, to more route business analytics. I'm looking to pivot back into a role that allows me to leverage my statistical modeling expertise more directly, similar to my time in research. Honestly, consulting has been rather disheartening, as I've just gotten stuck on projects that boil down to convoluted SQL scripts. I've tried expressing my desire to move to more complicated projects internally, as well as proposing extensions to projects that involve more complex statistics, but I've gotten shot down each time.

Could anyone share advice or strategies on how to find and land opportunities that align more closely with these interests? While I understand that most problems aren't going to require a complex statistical solution, I'm looking to find a role where my skills in statistics can be a cornerstone of my day-to-day responsibilities. Any insights on tailoring my job search, networking strategies, interviewing tips, or enhancing my skill set to be more attractive for these roles would be greatly appreciated.

I am particularly uncertain about these interviews because 2 out of the 4 interviewers are high-level executives (director level and plus with 15+ years experience) of purely finance background and I am not sure how to prepare for them in the best way because of the difference in background.  
  
  
  
for example:  
  
I have no official background in finance besides a minor in Econ and reading/trading stocks on the side (if that counts) and the job descriptions do mention that they prefer someone with experiences in financial services/exchange operations. What can I highlight to make up for that? Some examples showing that I am a fast learner?  
  
What kind of questions should I ask at the end of the interviews? Since they are fairly high level execs, I probably should not ask stuff regarding day-to-day operations. So I am thinking about general questions on what they look for in a DS candidate, advice on learning about finance on the job coming from a non-finance background, etc.  
  
What kind of questions should I NOT ask at the end of the interviews?  
  
  
  
some other context that may be helpful:  
  
I passed the first round 30-min screen with the hiring manager, and he did mention that finance background won't be too crucial as you will learn as you go but I am still surprised that I passed without a finance background  
  
then I passed a technical screen on Hackerrank, questions on SQL, 1 LC Easy, and some Python multiple choices  
  
so these 4 interviews are the second round

- Learn python and R
- Learn data warehousing

But my work has been stagnant in terms of career and I do not have a point of comparison within my company when it comes to technical excellence. I would love to know what more I can do to keep learning.

Regard drawing insights - this is really dependent on business knowledge and how well you understand the question you're trying to answer and how each tool answers it. This means that you can break down the problem into manageable chunks or subproblems/questions or hypotheses that you then test with an appropriate model, while also understanding the assumptions behind your model.

Price elasticities are usually *negative* (i.e., there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity). Sorry about that. They can be positive, but only in usual cases (either what are called Veblen goods or even more rarely Giffen goods). 

If e=-1 (called \"unit elastic\"), then a +5% change in price, then there is a -5% decrease in demand. 

If e=0 (called \"perfectly inelastic\"), then a change in price has no change in quantity demanded. Examples of highly inelastic goods is gas, medications, airline tickets, etc. Although in practice nothing is actually perfectly inelastic.

Usually the more inelastic a good is, the more economically justified it is to regulate the price. For example, in most places electricity and fuels used to heat homes are subject to some sort of government oversight to protect consumers (it's also justifiable to regulate them because they're also what are called \"natural monopolies\")."

It's hard to comment more without knowing what the context of your problem is, something you could try is to look at within-group autocorrelation, answering questions like \"if the first timestamp is long, is the second one more likely to be long?\" and so on.

The ordering does matter. To be transparent, I don't have a lot of context myself (though I'm actively trying to get more). The timestamps represent individuals who do certain operations, and the goal is trying to measure whether some activities are done correctly (or perhaps I should use 'consistently'). For that I need to identify what group of timestamps represents a set of meaningful actions. Unfortunately I can't get the context for that, all I have is the data and the internal patterns to help me identify those. For this reason, I have to group consecutive groups together (like 1 &amp; 2) but I can't group 1 &amp; 4 together without including 3 &amp; 4.  
  
Overall, I'm struggling to say whether in the above example this represents 4 actions, 2 actions, or a single action. In theory it could be any one of those, in practice, there's only one correct grouping. In principle, identifying the patterns is key to determining the right level to look at this, but at least so far I've done it in a fairly unsophisticated way."	"4_1"

Company based whitepapers can be a great source for real results. They can have great examples of findings from experiments done and how it can impact business. I like ones like this from Facebook on notifications because it can help highlight a common issue faced by data scientists. That is the business hates a science driven change because it hurts short term metrics in favor for improved long term ones. Getting stakeholders to give more than a couple weeks can be painful at times as they want instant results even if its not optimal.

This is solely on my personal beliefs and career goals (currently applying for masters in comp sci to be an MLE after being laid off from my DA job), but I dont think theres much evidence to say its a bad route even if you dont want to do research. End to end solo projects can also give you roughly similar exposure in data analysis, though obviously it wont come close to the same experience.

If you just want to start off as a data analyst, or if you just dont want to do the same work, its not a bad idea to intern at Lockheed. If you can get a return offer, with clearance as well, youll be in excellent shape job security wise. 

However, I believe LLNL will be a better opportunity in many ways. If will be very hard for recruiters not to be impressed if you have deep learning research in nuclear fusion at LLNL on your resume.

First off, congrats on landing those offers  each sounds like a unique opportunity with a lot to offer in the realm of data analytics and science. Based on what you've shared and aiming to dive into data analytics/science, here's a breakdown:



- \*\*National Lab LLNL (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory):\*\*

  - \*\*Pros:\*\*

- Deep learning experience, which is a cutting-edge aspect of data science.

- Involvement in the nuclear fusion process might give you unique data sets and problems to work on, different from typical business analytics scenarios.

- Continuity with your current research could mean deeper learning and understanding in a specialized area.

  - \*\*Cons:\*\*

- Might be very niche; ensure the skills you develop are transferrable to other data science domains if nuclear fusion isn't your long-term interest.



- \*\*USAA - Credit Risk Analyst Intern:\*\*

  - \*\*Pros:\*\*

- Direct exposure to data analytics tools like SQL, and possibly Python, which are staples in the data science field.

- Working with financial data could provide a solid foundation for understanding and predicting consumer behavior, a valuable skill in many industries.

  - \*\*Cons:\*\*

- Might be somewhat limited to financial analytics, so consider how much you're interested in this field long-term.



- \*\*Lockheed Martin - Operations Engineer Intern:\*\*

  - \*\*Pros:\*\*

- Offers a broad spectrum of data-related skills: forecasting, statistical analysis, and database operations, which are core to the field of data analytics.

- Exposure to different methodologies and tools (Data Mining, SQL Statements) could provide a well-rounded experience.

- The defense sector presents unique challenges and large datasets, useful for honing problem-solving skills in data science.

  - \*\*Cons:\*\*

- The focus might lean more towards operations engineering than pure data science, so the depth of data analysis exposure might vary.



\*\*Recommendation:\*\*

Each internship offers its own path into the world of data analytics and science, but based on diversity of applicable skills and the potential for broad exposure to data analytics processes, the \*\*Lockheed Martin Operations Engineer Intern\*\* position seems like it could offer you the most holistic entry into the field. You'll interact with various forms of data analysis and statistical tools, making it a versatile choice for building a foundation in data analytics/science.



Remember, though, personal interest and where you see yourself enjoying the work and learning the most is crucial. Consider what sector (nuclear fusion, financial risk, defense, and production) excites you the most, as passion is a significant driver of success in any field. Good luck with your decision!"	"7"

I talked to some Lockheed people who interned in similar roles last year and they mainly just worked with excel and tableau which is good but maybe not close to what Im looking for. Im leaning more towards the USAA position as that will open up a new point of view for me. Its only 2 months so if I dont like it Ill go into another domain but at least I will know what its like. They also offer full time roles for basically everyone and they also have machine learning roles for credit risk. As for LLNL I dont want my resume to have two similar positions with the same work even though LLNL might look the most prestigious."	"7_1"

slightly longer answer: For this project I anticipated refactoring it in short bursts over a long time period. In my experience this is far easier with Haskell vs anything else because the type system will remind you of most of the constraints you probably would have forgotten by the time you refactor (and I suppose this extends to other developers as well). Furthermore, haskell has great parsing libraries (aeson et al) which in this case is non-trivial since most of the job is downloading and processing JSON. Also the build tools for haskell are far easier to use in a reproducible manner (compared to conda for instance) which further enables all the above points.

As far as a web interface specifically, haskell has [one](https://www.yesodweb.com/) (at least) which I have yet to use because TBH every time I make an app like this (in any language) I try to justify making a web interface and fail because the CLI is good enough for what I need ;)

I will admit python (or go? I've never used it) probably has better web libraries, specifically for making wizzy data-sciency graphs; however, graphs and such were never part of the original scope anyways."	"1_1"

The main problem you will run into is only having observational data without any randomized or controlled data.

So you can build a model to predict who will be most likely to adopt chat in the near future. But that's not really what you care about.

What you actually care about is answering the question:

Who will have the biggest increase in probability to migrate to chat if we were to take action with some intervention (such as reaching out to the customer, etc.)

The difference is very important. For example, you might have two customers. One customer A has a 2% chance of migrating to chat and another customer B has a 98% chance of migrating to chat soon.

But those numbers are just the baseline observational predictions if you did nothing and don't intervene. Let's say you run another model that says if you were to reach out to customer and intervene, then customer A has a 42% chance of migrating and customer B would have a 99% chance of migrating.

So we can see in that case, by intervening on customer A we can increase their chances of migrating by 40%! But if we intervene on customer B, it only increases their chances by 1%. So we should just target customer A since they will be the highest ROI customers to intervene on.

One last thing, but ideally you should be running some RCT or A/B tests where you randomly intervene and contact customers. Otherwise your model won't be able to learn the causal relationship between your intervention and your outcome."	"1"

Id say CS with a program that specifically hits on data science, and if you really want to do OR specifically, try to take a class or two in the industrial engineering department related to optimization or simulation.

As a general rule, this problem can be minimized by selecting a testing set that is large enough (30 to 50% or so) and shows a distribution in the feature space as similar as possible to the one of the training set, so here things like stratified sampling can help. However, in this kind of setup, if you don't have enough data it will be not possible to ensure an \"independence\" (if any) between the training and the testing set.

A very different alternative is leave-one-out though. When model training is cheap (linear models trained on data of a moderate size), one can do something like this n times without risk of any data shift: select one sample at random, remove its neighbors (to increase \"independence\" between the training and the test set), train the model on the remaining samples, and predict over the selected sample. This procedure can be repeated as many times as needed to obtain a fair evaluation metric.

The significance of this shift can vary depending on several factors, including the nature of the data, the way the split is performed, and the model being used.

Dataset shift can impact the performance of machine learning models because the model might learn patterns that are not representative of the unseen data it encounters in the test set or in real-world application. This can lead to decreased accuracy and predictive performance when the model is deployed.

There are several strategies to minimize or manage dataset shift:

1. Stratified Sampling: When splitting your dataset, use stratified sampling to ensure that the proportion of each class in your target variable is consistent between the training and test sets. This approach is particularly useful for classification problems where class imbalance might exist.

2. Time Series Split: For time-dependent data, a chronological split that respects the temporal order of observations can help mitigate temporal shift. This involves training on past data and testing on more recent data.

3. Domain Adaptation Techniques: These techniques are designed to explicitly account for and minimize the effects of dataset shift when training and deploying models. They can be particularly useful in scenarios where the training and deployment environments are expected to differ systematically.

4. Cross-Validation: Using cross-validation techniques, especially in scenarios where data is limited, can help ensure that the model is robust and performs consistently across different subsets of the data.

5. Monitoring and Updating Models: Regularly monitoring model performance in the deployment environment and updating the model with new data can help manage dataset shift over time. This is especially important in dynamic environments where underlying patterns can change.

6. Covariate Shift Adaptation: When the input variables' distribution changes but the conditional distribution of the target given the inputs remains the same, techniques such as importance weighting can help adjust the training process to minimize the impact of covariate shift.

It's essential to analyze your data and model's context to choose the most appropriate strategy for mitigating dataset shift. Regular validation and monitoring are key to managing this issue effectively over time.

I also made notes to remember things. I also studied the available distance metrics that you can switch out in some algorithms. Also, every clustering algorithm working in a Euclidean or similar metric space expects your data to be normalized.

scikit-learn has the most famous basic algorithms, so its good to know them.

From my experience: Bayesian Gaussian mixture models are good and HDBSCAN. HDBSCAN also is a package on its own that has more knobs to turn and generates additional output.

There are some fundamental things you have to ask yourself about a given clustering algorithm:

* does it make assumptions on the shape of clusters?
* do clusters have to be of comparable extent, number of points and density?
* how well can it deal with the curse of dimensionality? This heavily depends on the metric that you are using, But none of them really do well, so dimensionality reduction without massively destroying cluster structure is a good idea, for example UMAP (Not included in scikit-learn). You can for example, use cross validated reconstruction error to find the optimal reduced dimensionality, or look at the clustering quality as a parameter of the target dimensionality.
* can it generate a probabilistic output?
* does it have an outlier bucket? (This can be very important)
* does it find the number of clusters itself or do I need to use some quality of clustering metric and optimize the number of clusters as a hyperparameter? (Unsupervised clustering quality metrics are included in scikit-learn, you should look at them also).
* can it classify new points?
* how does it deal with hierarchical clusters?

There is a really nice review from 2023. Its called:

An overview of clustering methods with guidelines for application in mental health research

Its really mostly about just clustering and very little about application in mental health research.

  
Also: I highly recommend the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow. It has about 60 pages on clustering and dimensionality reduction. All very simple explain with lots of pictures.

I would run first a dimensionality reduction algorithm, like UMAP, then a clustering algorithm like HDBSCAN, vary the parameters of UMAP and see how it impacts cluster quality and number of clusters, so the idea is to find the optimal dimensionality but also tune the other parameters a bit (they are more robust, but still)

Now you can probe where new points would fall. UMAP I think lets you map new or shifted points and also HDBSCAN. HDBSCAN also can give you class probabilities.

Note: To see if you even have clusters, I would try a bunch of simple dimensionality reduction techniques on the data (PCA) or maybe on some subspace of the data (reduced dimensionality). In addition there are metrics like the Hopkins statistic that assess how chunky your data is, and can give you a clue (supposedly) if you even have clusters.

If you dont have clusters, given that you seem to be talking about customer behavior, Factor Analysis might be worth a try (meaning you only do this particular dimensionality reduction and thats it. Without clustering afterwards). Then you get every customer projected down to a hopefully meaningful set of dimensions.

Tbh if your time series data is super shitty Id just look at pre vs post treatment or maybe bin your data (like in first month, second month, third month post treatment) and stick it in a Bayesian belief network. Can also just do non parametric tests like pre rollout vs the class. If you collected data over a super long time and theres seasonality or smth probably wouldnt be great but seems like this was a rush job by whoever coordinated so you shouldnt have to worry abt it. 

Or do a naive Bayes classifier where x is time since rollout, y is time since start of data collection, and outcome is usage of coupon.

It's also important to comment that hype-words (Kubernetes; which data scientists know it well enough to do something useful and stable? It's not a good use for your time.) used by HRs are bullshit we engineers (you kind of are now) need to take with criticism.

However, I was a SWE for a few years, I would strongly suggest that if you need an API, analytics, etc., you don't implement it by yourself. I once moved all of the infra to a cloud provider using only services like elastic Beanstalk and analytics services that work with logs in buckets. The gain is huge since you get monitoring almost for free and eventually, the setup becomes much less fragile. You are facing a decision with at least three options: 1. you do implement monitoring for the probably messy setup you already have (probably not realistic to make monitoring actionable in this case, you will re-invent the wheel). 2. if it's cheap and easy, you move to services instead of this custom (perhaps) mess. 3. new services will use robust tools and not custom, fragile solutions. Ideally, you do not want to code infra. Code is bad, code is bugs.

I am not really sure what automated cleaning means, but I assume you have scripts that transform the data. For that, you should learn about data pipelines. Essentially, what you do, is extract the data, transform it, and send it to the relevant service/other pipeline. Ideally, you want the process divided into multiple steps with assertions, so you can see where failure occurs. I used a CI/CD tool for that, but there are probably better solutions (again, cloud services).

I definitely think that you should provide more specifics, i.e., how many services do we talk about? If it's \~5 you can possibly migrate to better deployment tools, if 100, not so much... What are the costs? Does it use many resources? It's all about tradeoffs."	"1"

This should trigger my PySpark script to automatically clean the data and store it in our database, eliminating the need for manual CSV handling, script execution, and data storage on my part.

As of now, I've deployed six services, making it relatively simple for me to migrate everything while the setup is still fresh in my mind. Regarding costs, I'm currently uncertain. I've been leveraging open-source libraries, which meet our needs without any expense but require a more hands-on approach. It's unclear how much my company is willing to invest in such services, but I assume the budget is limited. Our requirements don't call for extensive functionality; we need modest dashboards integrated into web applications for each client. The projects are small-scale, with each web application supporting no more than 50 users.

In terms of resources, our web applications consume minimal amounts. They comprise straightforward front-end and back-end components. On the hardware side, we only require storage for our databases since our user base does not significantly strain RAM or CPU resources.

Given these considerations, could you recommend any services that cover the entire data stack? I'm not well-versed in comprehensive service options and, given our small-scale operations, we don't need the extensive solutions that larger companies might require.

Also, I code all the dashboards and web-applications because I like to code! I have to admit, migrating everything to services makes me feel I took a Msc. for nothing..."	"1_1"

Suppose you sample two datasets of size N that you evaluate your model on. It makes sense that the AUCROC computed on both datasets may differ due to the random sampling and finite datasets.

I can see how distribution shifts might change the performance, but that should decrease the performance of the model fitted to the previous distribution, unless something exceptional happens, right?

The internal set is balanced???? Well that answers all your questions right there lol.

The test set should NEVER be upsampled or downsampled in any way.

The fact that they are evaluating on an artificially balanced test set tells me that all of the results are entirely meaningless and useless in my opinion.

That is just a large and glaring error that I wouldn't trust much of anything else in the study.

EDIT: One last addition, but you mention there are thousands of rows with a 95/5 balance. That would imply that there are potentially less than a hundred positive samples.

Don't forget that AUCROC is essentially the probability of properly ranking one randomly selected positive sample and one randomly selected negative sample.

So if your dataset has less than 100 positive samples, you will see higher variance in your estimate intuitively. 

But even with that being said, the fact that authors evaluated on an artificially balanced test set tells me that there are likely a lot more glaring errors and issues in the entire paper to render it useless."	"1_1_1"

Alternative possibilities include:

1. Data Splitting: The validation dataset might be more representative of the overall population than the training dataset. If the validation data happens to have clearer patterns or less noise, the model could perform better on it.

2. Model Overfitting: It's possible that the model is overfitting to the training data, capturing noise or specific patterns that are not generalizable. This can lead to lower performance on unseen data, such as the validation set. Regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, or early stopping could help mitigate overfitting.

3. Imbalanced Classes: Class imbalances between the training and validation datasets could affect AUROC scores. If the validation set has a more balanced distribution of classes, the AUROC might appear higher compared to the training set.

4. Data Leakage: Leakage of information from the validation set into the training process can inflate performance metrics on the validation set. Ensure that data preprocessing steps, such as normalization or feature scaling, are performed separately for the training and validation datasets to prevent leakage."	"3"

While current generation LLM dont specifically do word associations, essentially they have those associations modeled in their weights or else they couldnt do what they do. 

Early model examples of this were like Markov chains and LSTM. But more often you find these do character associations to a leading window of characters. Modern architectures are attention based.

Unless you mean, can one be trained to express the same association you expect? Also yes, it could be as simple as telling it thusly that sky -&gt; blue in your seed text and hoping that sticks around in the token. Or concatenating that at the beginning of each submitted prompt or something. Otherwise, you could do transfer learning and have it refine its weights to your desired associations in some extra bit of corpus. "	"5"

The 5 year or so ebb and flow of hiring for the latest shiny thing. I guarantee in the medium term we will see the culling of all the minor AI players whose business cases were never realized. There will be some that succeed to become the next Facebook or Salesforce but most will just fold. So it will be as hard then to get a job to be an AI engineer as today it is to be a general purpose software developer. These things are just cyclic based on technology shifts. Initial demand leads to everyone jumping on the bandwagon, leading to oversupply from schools as the actual technology space fails to expand at the predicted rate.

Specialist and niche skills will always be in demand when coupled with soft skills and salaries at a realistic level. I predict the demand for embedded software engineers with C type language skills, Cobol and JCL mainframe skills, device driver writers, scientific programmers with Fortran experience and so on will hold steady as they have for the last 20 years. Advanced experience in statistics will hold up in demand too. Web IT software developer demand however will fluctuate with the tide of forever changing newest technologies that appear to reinvent themselves every 10 years.

Funnily enough I think there will be a rapid increase in demand for people to develop effective bots for human interactions in query and support services. Hailed as the big new opportunity for AI, its probably the one area that AI has failed to even pass the Turing test at times. Most bot services prove to be largely useless for all but the most simplistic of tasks and humans hate them, with a passion. I have yet to experience myself anything approaching the level of even the worst of human support services with any of the AI bots Ive been subjected to. They are by and by largely hopeless and turn a cost reduced customer enquiry or support service transaction into the biggest possible loss of customers revenue you could ever hope for.

Every time I encounter good online or phone service whereby I talk to a knowledgeable support agent, I have spent money with that company. Its a marvelous sales vehicle. Every time I talk to a support agent who knows less than i do about the problem, or even worse a bot that cannot even understand I have a problem, I return the item or buy some other product. Decent AI may help a good support agent do a better job faster, but as soon as it is forward facing I just despair. I often call support services now before I buy into some kind of ecosystem in order to judge whether their support is helpful or merely an annoyance that is really programmed to get you to give up as quickly as possible.

I was calling Medicare plans this past couple of weeks to decide on my future plan purchases. Only one, probably the most surprising one to be honest, that being UHC, who actually forwarded me quickly to an extremely, knowledgeable support person who answered my detailed questions with expertise and helpful suggestions. Despite not being the cheapest Medigap plan I bought it anyway because I had confidence in that they knew their product, warts and all. All the other bot laden services drove me into a condition where I might actually need medical care."	"5_1"

We already have self driving cars and a lot of use cases for robotic arms. This will impact millions in the short term.

There will likely be a period over a few years where automation is introduced and we all struggle to maintain and adapt. In this period there won't be massive layoffs IMO, but they could come after that. This is where retraining and UBI will be a huge saving grace for the standard American.

Consider voting for leaders who are actively discussing these issues and how greatly they impact everyone who doesn't have a STEM degree. Not every American can code, but its possible that with the significant gains in capital produced by automation, that wealth could be redistributed to create a utopia where Americans working minimum wage roles could be free to produce art or work a passion that previously could not be possible without robotics and the post-scarcity world they create."

But AI will not always grow at an exponential rate, after some time it will plateau and then its limitations will emerge. It's difficult to understand what possible limitations it might have but it will surely emerge in due time.

So, AI will make a lot of jobs go extinct but not all of the jobs and it will create a lot of new jobs also.

I also think that a lot of companies will use AI to expand rather than focus entirely on cost cutting. For example, if the job of 10 people can be done by 2 then companies will give 4 more projects to the remaining 8 and expand their capacity. AI will lead to a more efficient utilisation of resources so the resources will be used to expand capacity, because during industrialisation when a producer realised that he can get the same work done in less time and with less people then he started producing more in same time with maybe a bit less people."

I think the industry in general expected hardware to evolve faster than the software i.e. we would have the hardware capabilities to build a robot that does plumbing for instance long before the AI/software would be good enough to make say an AI lawyer. 

Turns out that's not the case, or at least it's not so obvious. The irony is that all those manual jobs your parents always told you to avoid in favour of college degrees are looking more stable than ever, at least in relative terms. We'll probably have an AI lawyer long before an AI bricklayer.

Let's break down your points and add some additional insights:

1. **AI Tools for Data Scientists**: Absolutely, the primary users of AI tools in data science are data professionals themselves. The emphasis on making these tools work for them rather than replacing them underscores the role of AI as an augmentative technology. It's critical that these tools are designed with the end-user in mind, focusing on usability, integration into existing workflows, and genuinely solving the challenges faced by data scientists. This user-centric approach is essential for widespread adoption.

2. **Productivity Benefits with Human Oversight**: Your point about AI providing productivity benefits while requiring human oversight is spot-on. Tools like GitHub Copilot serve as powerful examples of how AI can boost efficiency and creativity without eliminating the need for human expertise. In data science, AI can automate routine tasks (data cleaning, preliminary analysis, etc.) but the nuanced understanding, decision-making, and strategic thinking that data scientists bring to the table are irreplaceable. This partnership between AI and humans enhances the analytical process rather than detracting from it.

3. **Lowering Barriers to Data Access**: The comparison to the advent of spreadsheets is enlightening. By making data more accessible and the analysis process more efficient, AI tools could indeed democratize data science to an extent, expanding the pool of data professionals and enabling more complex and deeper analyses. This doesn't mean reducing the value of data scientists but rather empowering more individuals to engage in data-driven decision-making and innovation.

4. **Simplifying the Presentation of Insights**: The potential for AI to streamline the conversion of complex analyses into digestible formats is exciting and has significant implications for how insights are communicated across organizations. By reducing the time and effort required to translate findings into actionable business insights, AI can facilitate a more agile, informed decision-making process. This aspect of AI's impact could bridge the gap between data science and non-technical stakeholders, enhancing the strategic value of data analysis.

Your journey through various roles in the data domain within FAANG companies highlights a crucial point: regardless of the position, data literacy and the ability to leverage data effectively are key differentiators. This narrative reinforces the idea that as AI evolves, the core skills that define a proficient data professionalcritical thinking, problem-solving, and storytelling with datawill remain invaluable.

Overall, your perspective suggests a future where AI enhances the field of data science by augmenting human capabilities, making data more accessible, and streamlining the communication of insights, all while emphasizing the irreplaceable value of human intuition and expertise in"	"7"

The common advice for \"stakeholder management\" is various ways of saying \"No\" and/or advice about project management. However I feel that this is just a small part of what stakeholder management actually is. In my experience doing stakeholder management WELL is actually more about the ART of understanding the politics of your own position in relation to the politics of the company/organization as a whole. Once you understand that you can develop the relationships you need in order to effectively manage your workload (by saying No/de-prioritization or ignoring requests). The reason I call it an art is because there's no one-size-fits-all way of doing this. It's entirely context-dependent and is about understanding who is asking for something, what level of power they hold, and who you need to be on your side (\"cover you\") if and when you have to say No. 

For more junior people, the key relationships are probably their own manager and (probably more effectively) their manager's manager. For more senior people, it usually becomes more about creating relationships with the most senior cross-functional people you can. This is all has to be done ahead of time. In other words: Saying No to people will almost for sure piss them off to some extent and the goal here is to PREEMPT THEM by using the hierarchy of the organization to your own leverage. Like the best circumstance is when people are pissed off at you but they barely even bother to pursue it because they know it's already a lost situation for them. 

Of course: as a junior person this is much more challenging when your own leaders don't do this themselves. I've found as a manager it's vital for me to do all of this to protect peoples' time. There are also certainly circumstances where the culture of the company/org is to just grind everyone to dust and it's very hard to get around that but I'd argue those are the situations where you get the experience and money you need from the role and then get out of there ASAP (which it sounds like basically what happened to the woman who made the Youtube video)."

I'm a SWE, not a data scientist, but my answer for a case like this is quite simple.

Me: \"I'm struggling to meet the demands here. My understanding is that this is a very important and high priority initiative, is that right?\"

Stakeholder: \"Yes, it's very high priority and urgent.\"

Me: \"So why am I the only person who's working on it? Can we get more resources?\"

Then the stakeholder is forced to either backtrack and admit that the urgency and priority isn't as high as they're making it out to be, or else is forced up the chain of command to provide additional resources.

Unfortunately, wielding that power a bit too flippantly will have long-term political ramifications out in the real world, even in a relatively rational and success-oriented org culture. IMO the best play in these situations is not to bristle, but try and reflect the stakeholder's excitement and commitment to success on the project, work hard (but not so hard you burn yourself out), but be realistic about the fact that you're just one person and that's going to make it possibly slower than they'd hope.

If there are good managers around, they'll ask you directly: \"what do you need to make it go faster?\" And you should have an answer ready. If it's more people with specific skills, say that.

Believe me, I've been anxiously aware of that. I just turned 30 this week and my entire 20s I knew I could get by due to my youth but I can't maintain the same throughput and intensity in my 30s. I've built and bootstrapped roughly 6-8 registered companies in my 20s spanning a few industries. I mainly funded it through another business I launched.

I've mainly been founding startups and some of the past deals have been in the lower double digit million amounts, covid unfortunately cost me that deal and it was almost cleared. Startup expenditures and other factors come in to play as well. Currently I have a very big upside in telecommunications, the issue is this part of the industry has a horrible software standard (oss) and so I'm kinda forced to build the erp software while doing mostly everything else. I can delegate but they all feel like interns until we scale and I can hire better talent. Talent is hard to find.

I've taken a backseat to dating, social, holidays and vacations. Currently I'm still pushing but I'm feeling severely fatigued, energy levels bottomed out. The light at the end of the tunnel is very high amounts of appreciation monetarily, my monthly payout scales with the number of customers, at a bottom 10% that would still result in me having roughly 40-100k a month and when I get there most things will be automated per my work. However, until we get there, the work on my plate feels disgusting. 

You sound incredibly successful, I think after I'm done automating everything, my weekly hours will drop to 20 hopefully and I can regain some of my own time once more. My friends and family are of course worried about my workload and work habits as well. Ultimately I think I have another 1-2 years max in me at this pace before I just can't anymore. I have pivots in place should that happen, but optimistically the next 3-5 months will be the most cruicial. The profits I would take would go into real estate, and funding some r&amp;d for two of my biotech projects."	"3_6_1_1"

Task estimation has been repeatedly studied as a phenomenon.

Humans consistently underestimate how long tasks take. They consistently underestimate it even when *reminded that humans underestimate how long tasks take and have previous underestimates pointed out to them*.

So the simple answer is just pad it out, and then pad it out some more. You should feel a little embarrassed at how much you've padded it out. That's about the right spot. And start tracking your work and how long things actually take.

The complex answer is that when given a \"generous\" deadline humans start slowing down, mucking about in details, etc etc. That's why it's really important to combine generous deadlines with more strict, goal orientated styles of project management."	"5_2_2"

My experience on those teams was at mid-growth-stage startups in zero-interest era. IMO, a lot of those DS were not ever necessary, and yeah, a lot have gotten laid off in the past years, but the ones with a little more vision left on their own before that.

I'm not on data teams anymore but the DS team I work with now is small but managed well. They have a lot of backlog but the top is prioritized according to what needs to get done. A lot of us who are still working in tech rn are probably working a little harder, but still, managers should manage expectations / priorities / politics in a way to not have people working 10-12 hours for months. She also mentions she has a very strong identity tied to her job and she's young and doesn't know better -- that probably made this worse.

If you think of the current macroenvironment coupled with the fact that Spotify has generally not been profitable, even in zero interest times, then. yeah. maybe not the best place. Anyway, she's very privileged, has a good resume item that also helped her build her youtube (nice side money potentially). She'll be fine. You'll be fine."	"13"

This was at a start up with a lot of problems, but it just killed me that we were struggling to do some very basic product things, like consistently delivering a valuable product, and here was a team burning millions per year without any idea how what they were doing was going to contribute.  


Prioritization for these projects is just so hard to get right. Maybe it's the interface between technical and non-technical stakeholders, but I also think there's a fair bit of \"if we could only do X, that's what the customer wants\" without properly prioritizing that work within the context of what can be done at the current resource levels."

I think a lot of companies are figuring out they have to strategize their spend better in the current environment, some doing better than others. I'd take the interview experience as a chance to get to see who your manager would be, what they're working on, what tech they're using, why they need you. There are also subtle ways to ask about culture. IMO that stuff is almost as important, or more important, than the actual company name, unless you're at a FAANG / good resume name. 

Just so you know, tech and DS allows for a lot of jumping, so for your first role, I wouldn't get too hung up. Hopefully you land something good, otherwise jump ship when you can line something else up. 

When it comes to spotify specifically, I haven't heard a ton about their culture, but as someone who's worked in music, I'll say the industry itself is tough. There's a lot of money being paid out to people, and yet it feels like no one is making substantial money, except I guess maybe the record labels. More streaming (aka growth) = more royalties to be paid, and more growth for Spotify = more money for the labels to ask for a larger portion of. That's probably why Spotify is doing the big podcast bet, and also audiobooks now. Just my two cents on that end. Don't want to discourage you, but it's just the reality of music :/ (edit: i will add, there are other DS jobs in music, they might net less money and/or less prestige. otherwise, the other major streamers could also be options since many have other income)."

I was making 175k a year as a Senior Scrum Master for 2 teams.  1 team of 5 developers + a data scientist (I come from analytics and metrics development myself).  My 2nd team was part of a marketing team.

Anyway, I was working 10 hours a day, sleep was getting worse, and my manager wasn't supportive.  My hobbies were slowly fading away and I was just working + trying to sleep + cooking for my wife and I.

My manager was pretty much AFK and he didn't even know what projects we were working on unless I told him - so no support at all.

Anyway, I quit back in sept.  got a new job now in an unrelated field, but it's giving me time to pursue a new degree!  And I like my new job, manager, team, etc.  And I like where my life is going.   Oh yeah and it's a 100k pay cut.  But whatever, wife and I are fine financially.  Avg salary for the career I'm pursuing is 200k so fingers crossed that a few years from now I'll be better off than I was before.

Two stand-ups each day.  Two grooming sessions each week for 2 teams (4 total sessions).  2 demos every 2 weeks.  2 retros every 2 weeks.  2 refinements with sprint kick-off every 2 weeks.

I was also Scrum of Scrum for a large project (moving data from a data center - we had an entire facility just for data - to the cloud (AWS).  These meetings were 1 hour every week.  14 SMs giving updates.

Scrum stuff was in the morning because half the team was in India.  Other half in US.  Morning worked best.  Between both teams, 1 hour each day for stand-ups.  2 hours some days if it was refinement, retro, or demo.

So I typically had project meetings and cross team dependency meetings 4 hours each day.  Status updates, etc.

And I also had 1:1s with all team members 30 minutes every 2 weeks.  15 total team members across 10 days meant at least 30 minutes each day of 1:1 time.  Sometimes and hour.

Then I had 1:1s with other SMs on the project which took time.

This didn't count company all hands meetings, dept meetings, or whatever else random shit came up.

Prioritization and value. Those are two important skills for any DS. DS is fun and addictive, its really easy to spend an enormous amount of time on low value items.

Whenever there's a human behaviour that doesn't make rational sense, then the reason likely is not a rational one.

Then you can look at the emotional and systemic reasons:

* have to support a family and work in an environment where you can get fired because someone got offended by the wrong joke? 
* no one ever taught you how to say \"no\" in a constructive way or how to set boundaries? That creates uncertainty. Rational behaviour in humans and uncertainty aren't the best mix. 
* or you actually know how to say \"no\" but you've had the wrong people in your life who get super offended by a reasonable request because it inconveniences them momentarily? Your behaviour kinda adapts because no matter how strong you are as an individual, you're not in a vacuum and subject to the community of people around you.

Also, it's a question of perception. If everyone does overtime and you don't see anyone speak up against it, then in your perception, everyone does it and for all intents and purposes this is what \"normal\" is.

* optimisation of time management - sometimes we can do more by doing less (spending more time in the initial phase when you translate the stakeholder question to a data problem might do wonders)
* transparent comms regarding the effort to the stakeholder and the manager i.g. by creating a centralised and transparent pipeline that can be used for prioritisation purposes
* bargaining (e.g \"I can give you A and B now but C will have to wait as it's high effort low reward\", \"What is the minumum you need to enabled?\")

If that's all done and the workload is still too high for an extended period (work sometimes comes in waves) then I'd bring it up with the manager as more help is required in a constant level. What might help is to show how the currently limited resources might negatively impact the business (the risks) or what other benefits it might have to get more resources.

1) Weird video, especially the beginning and when she laughed while giving her resignation.

2) Lead data scientist, sole data scientist, highest priority project.. thats a senior position or higher, not L2. She should have had a lead on the project with her, or rapid advancement commensurate with those responsibilities. Thats an organizational failure. Healthy grain of salt, its likely she means a highest priority project local to her department, not at Spotify.

3) Seeking a new job was the right choice, though I would not have quit.  I think it would have been better to scale back her hours to ~6 / day while job hunting. Ride the paychecks while interviewing, until she found a new role or was fired."	"62"

The problem is that, if this is something that changed while you were already employed (i.e., new boss/new project that starts demanding &gt;8 hours a day), then any attempt to protect your personal time could get you fired, PIPed, laid off, etc. 

I think it's one thing when a group *accidentally* overloads a person - i.e., that person doesn't know how to say no, and they end up taking on more that they can handle. But when a team is just ok with giving people more work than they can do in a 40 hour week, odds are that if you go to them and say \"no\", they're going to say \"ok, I'll find someone who will\".

If you find yourself in a job that is overworking you like that, really you just need to start looking for another job asap. If you have the runway and a good enough job market, it may even be worth quitting the job and then looking for a new job full time. But really the only real solution is finding a new job."	"67"

That's why my next two last sentence was this - because you're right, some jobs just don't really allow you the time to prepare for, interview for, etc. another job. And if that's the case then what you really need to do is build yourself a runway however you can and then quit. Which is easier said than done. 

Now, mind you - one thing to note is that most large companies will never fire you on the spot. If you start slowing down and not getting \"enough\" done, they will put you on a PIP, and that can take like 3 months to really get done especially if you don't outright stop working but just quiet quit a bit. But even in those instances, you need to be ready to somewhat field the pressure of a boss that is going to be breathing down your neck, furious about not having you working yourself to death."

Given the space limitations of YouTube and Reddit, well never know What Really Happened, even if she herself knows. Still, a lot of good advice here for anybody working a salaried staff role like DS. It comes down to two things: 1) self-protection and 2) self-promotion. Self-protection is avoiding bad situations like the young woman got herself into by managing the managers and knowing how to say no in a constructive way and also knowing when a job is past salvaging and best option is to bail. Self-promotion is not wasting your time (and company time) by working on things that dont create value. That is an easy trap to fall into in DS. Just because something is cool in tech terms doesnt mean you should be doing it, especially if a Power BI dashboard will do just fine. Finally, Im glad someone used the correct term work to rule rather than the pejorative quiet quit. I understand that in the at will environment in the U.S. all these things are hard to do, but you have to try.

You can model units sold by taking a log transformation of quantity sold, product price. Taking log(Q)=a + b*log(P). For this equation the parameter b has an actual meaning which is price elasticity of demand. taking log of those two quantities also has the benefit as it scales the values and you minimise the effects where some products sell ridiculous amounts of quantities whereas some other products sell less (e.g. expensive products).

This equation can be expanded further where you add other variables that explain the sell-ability of your products (seasonality, holidays, promotions, website traffic) and model it as linear equation.

You can even introduce non-linearity by multiplying terms together but this requires a careful consideration if you want to be able to explain.

You are basically running a causal inference methodology on a set of observational data.

If you train a linear regression model on observational data and then look to the coefficients for insights, you have to be super super super careful. You are essentially measuring the correlation between each feature and target conditioned on all other features.

If you were using the model for only its forecasting accuracy of sales numbers, then you would be safer and don't need to satisfy as many assumptions.

But it sounds like you are trying to use the model to gather insights and potentially take actions, which is basically trying to run causal inference on a set of observational data which can easily go horribly wrong for a lot of reasons and give you completely backwards insights.

Unless you are able to perform some randomized controlled trials where you can perform random interventions on the key independent features then I would avoid analyzing the linear models coefficients too much.

The NN/AI hype is super loud in the upper echelons of big corporations. The people there are usually not technical experts- ofte nthey are MBAs or company lifers that dont understand the tradeoffs between models. They have been brainwashed into thinking AI solves any problem better. 

So they hire expensive AI consultants to forecast next quarter's shipping costs. This allows them to tell their Board of Directors that they are \"doing AI\" to \"maximize efficiencies\".

Often they dont even have enough data to train a big NN properly.

In theory, Im 100% on the Leo Breiman train that accuracy is all that matters and big, complex models are superior in all domains. 

In practice, only a few companies and business cases require NNs (outside the natural NN realms of speech/video/generative).

90% of companies do not have enough data, sufficiently complex businesses, or enough at stake to use NNs effectively. If youre a $1BN dollar company that cleans medical offices, maintains residential HVAC systems, or does freight forwarding, almost all your business cases will be best handled with simpler models.

If you've got 10 features and you know a priori 3 of them are irrelevant, then just keep it simple.

The size of the database matters less than the diversity. For an NN to be worth it, you need to push the number of features you're using and the types of features you're using. Once you get to 20, 30 features with a bunch of complicated interactions, then yea- an NN truly starts to shine. But having 20 years of hourly observations of one variable isnt worth much.

And I've actually seen businesses that think because they have 10 gigabytes worth of observations for one or two variables they have something valuable- they dont. Not for an NN.

To summarize, there are two typical issues I encounter irl:

1. The business only consistently collects data for a handful of features (i.e. POS, inventories, worker hours, etc.).

2. The business has a dataset that wont get fed reliable new data in the future

2 drives me nuts btw. You can build a big, one-off dataset with 50 features by paying for a bunch of 3rd party data. Thats great for a Kaggle competition.

But for business purposes what counts is the quality and reliability of the data you'll get in the future, not what you have right now. If you invest in an NN built on a dataset half of which will degrade in the future, then you might as well not have anything.

GLM, GAM, and GBMs are the bedrock of dynamic insurance pricing in the UK, and I don't see that changing for a while. But the difference between GLM and GBMs is night and day, so I'd advise you to look into that for at least some of the models your company wants to build OP."	"18"

I am taking over a project and my old manager did regressions and only linear regressions and it was so bad. We have a messed up pricing and i am under a lot of stress.

So i would like to understand exactly how a linear regression would work. Because that shit did not work.  In fact it was so bad it couldnt segment properly in practice with any down stream optimization. 


And research actually goes about how regressions are very weak especially when data has a semblance of non linearity when their is an optimization component. Unless the data is super linear its fine, but when there is none then regression models absolutely fall apart in any data that has noise. 

Correct me if im wrong, but i think GBM, GAM, and MARS are exceptional good models because they are super robust.

Regression always deserves a chance, but tree based models are just built different and especially when you can have additive regression trees with business constraints will do the same job but with way better performance .

Maybe a neural network with one single layer and linear activation would be better than a linear regression, and interpretable enough. The \"neural network takes days to train\" part means that a wrong and overly complicated model is being used, e.g. a lstm, or something like that.

I understand that sometimes a simple model is better, but I think it's even better to understand the basics behind a model to be able to use it in the right ocassion.

That's an important feature of simple models a lot of people miss

In many applications, simple models also tend to generalize better than complex ones. I'm reminded of the M competitions for forecasting, where dumb exponential smoothing just kept beating out all sorts of complicated methods. 

But I don't think linear regression is underrated really. A few people who always want the \"latest big thing\" and want to add a 0 to the end of their bill for doing something that a basic approach would work on might downplay it but people who are actually into producing useful results quickly have a pretty good idea why it's been a standard tool for so very long.

I often tend to use GLMs or other generalizations of regression, but it's not because I think that regression is not the bees knees; it's the very productive base on which much else relies.

There's a lot of tweaks on regression that are useful in various contexts. It's worth understanding the basic tools thoroughly."	"43"

There are interactions, multiple flavours of non-linearities, resampling methods that go far beyond CV, GLM, GAM, penalization/shrinkage/regularization etc. etc. When a thoughtful and sensible linear model is fitted, it often competes with NNets in terms of out of sample accuracy and far outperforms the latter in terms of inference and explanatory (i,e, loosely causal) power.

As a business person first and a data junkie second, I always require a two main initialization steps with any type of predictive modeling.

First, we take all the suspect independent variables and run them in cross-tabs so that we can visually inspect any correlations. This is an important step because the algos, while novel and enticing, can't substitute for human understanding of common sense items that are organically generated in the data. Now, this does not mean you are finding causality in the correlations. You are making notes about linkages and possible explanations. It makes the team smarter and increases intuition around the direction you are headed.

Second, we always use an algorithm competition where we test  different prospective algos (including statistical methods) and question all of the results. Each one needs common sense interpretation and rerunning with different features or independent variables to see how the results change. By doing these two things, you systematize an approach to finding the best approach for predictive modeling.

It takes more time to do all of this, but it is well worth it because helps train team members to apply common sense and business understanding. It also creates alignment in execution."	"92"

The fact is, most of this stuff predates AI and ML.  Money people and marketers rebrand all the time.  Even the term data science wasn't a thing until a few years ago, yet there were people doing the same things data scientists were doing long before that term came along.  They just called them physicists, chemists, statisticians, operations research, computer scientists, etc.

A lot of younger folks (I still think of myself as young, but actual young people don't) never learned or were taught the history of statistical science. IMO the programs that taught them 'cutting edge machine learning' or whatever had a vested interest in neglecting it. Obviously there are wonderful examples of folks building and giving a full accounting of 'statistical learning' and how it came to be, but I think a lot of places just elide all that. Harder to sell debt to bright-eyed kids if you admit the math is older than anyone you know and a lot of it is right on wikipedia.

Stats = ML; AI means whatever it means this week. For a long time there was this hazy idea that the more computationally heavy methods we put in the bin marked \"ML\" can be thought of as statistics specifically applied to the problem of prediction. I still think that's reasonably fair."	"46_1"

Also finance conpanies have some regulations on models of having closed to unbiased  models.  You cant break those regulations.  That would mean LSE and OLS work mostly. But they call it AI lol.

It's just that the non-technical community's interpretation of AI is more terminator and less \"model that prices things using tabular data\". But they are both AI - they are both emulating the tasks that were previously done by people.

Now, I agree - this is a very misleading practice of a lot of companies to advertise their stuff as AI when they know full well their customers are thinking LLMs and deep learning, and where their models are a single regression tree. 

But unfortunately that's how businesses operate. Everywhere. That's why shampoo commercials display illustrations of \"ribbons of moisture\" weaving through your hair - or why cosmetics will tell you this has fulumenilic acid in it (in spite of no one actually knowing if that's good or bad).

Personally, I am concerned about the backlash, because my perception is that everyone wants to use Gen AI, but the problem is that Gen AI is not great at the things that most companies care about. It's great at collateral things that sort of run in the background, but that's not going to be enough to warrant this huge investment in Gen AI.

What is the difference between a data scientist today and a statistical analyst of yesterday? Not much, maybe data scientists use python now and Jupyter notebooks instead of R and markdown files. But the original vision for the data scientist as described by Harvards infamous article describing data science as the sexiest job was not just a rebranding of a statistical analyst. 

Data science made its debut in product. The product was always the algorithm that helped automate decision making. Recommender systems, translation, most recently chat bots. These are the things that originally got us excited about data science when we were laymen. Even in the infamous article Data Scientist: the Sexiest Job if the 21st Century, they primarily use the Linkedin recommender system as the tool that revolutionized the business. A product - not a report, not a stakeholder meeting, etc. 

When the decision scientist title existed, data science was still about predictive analytics. Decision scientists have effectively been swallowed by the data science brand as expectations of what data scientists should do shifted. This impacted the field turning data science into a primarily product geared position, to more of a consultant. This is what caused the huge expectation for data scientists to revolutionize business by looking at the data and uncovering hidden trends that would give business x a huge competitive advantage and blow the rest of the competition in the dust. Thats why companies use to be willing to pay so much money for a data scientist. We all know, for the vast majority of companies& it didnt work out that way. 

Before the ML Engineer title existed, data scientists were the ML guys. ML use to be the very core of data science and what differentiated them from traditional analysts. It was forward looking more than backward looking. Facebooks data science core team use to require research degrees in CS and/or Statistics to be in this core team. Other companies were less restrictive, but their core data scientists also researched and applied machine learning methodologies. It wasnt until Lyft entered the business that core data scientists began rebranding themselves as machine learning engineers and data science became more focused on analysis than product.

In 2018 Lyft singlehandedly changed the data science landscape. One if Lyfts core problems when hiring analytical staff was that due to the insane hype around data science, everyone was calling themselves a data scientist whether or not they had the skills to understand and apply machine learning. Lyft noticed that when they rebranded their unpopular BI roles as data scientists, these class of people that knew nothing about predictive analysis but called themselves data scientists would apply for these roles at mass. (They got paid more too given the new title) And those were exactly the type of people that Lyft needed. You know excel and can make some visualizations on tableau? Great welcome to the data science team. Now the data science umbrella composed mainly of BI analysts, data analysts, core data scientists, and everything in between. I believe at this time the Chief Data Scientist of some tech company infamously changed his instagram handle to read Machine Learning Engineer to differentiate himself from the new trend of what data science was becoming. 

How did this happen? Well, weve all been there or heard this story. You get onboarded as a data scientist at a company, the CEO has created a whole data science team, everyone can make a dashboard, everyone knows excel. There is no data engineering team, no product, no path forward. That is why the CEO hired so many data scientists anyway, to uncover his businesses future. Next month, and hundreds of thousands of dollars later the entire team is gutted, the CEO is fired, and the company is restarting their data practice from the bottom up starting with data engineers and software engineers. Cant code? Youre not in. Cant build products youre not in. Youre on the data science team? Great, how are those KPIs looking this month? Expectations of what data science was supposed to be were way too high. Data Scientists were expected to be business magicians and lead companies next to business leaders. Some did, most didnt. Now people have a more realistic perspective for the data science role as a non revolutionary analyst type role.

Whos to blame and whats the lesson? 
No ones to blame, this is the hype cycle that has existed with every new thing in business. Theres a whole Gen AI hype right now where everyone thinks AI is a chatbot. Maybe this is a cautionary tale to business leaders and aspiring data professionals to dig deeper beyond the hype so youre not left disillusioned. 

TL:DR;
Data science teams were mainly product focused machine learning teams until Lyft changed the landscape and rebranded their BI Analysts as Data Scientists. This rebranding was good for Lyft, but left many smaller companies disillusioned with Data Scientists as they began hiring BI Analyst types with the expectations that data science will revolutionize their company to become industry leaders. Those who pioneered advancements in machine learning under the data scientist title have rebranded themselves as machine learning engineers to differentiate themselves. Now the data science role is a non extraordinary analyst type role. Be careful around hype cycles so you too are not left disillusioned."	"3"

That isnt an average DS anymore and hasnt been since like 2019. The average DS after the rebranding has basically the skillset of an analyst. Look at how much agreement that asking questions about the  assumptions behind some basic stat models like log/lin regression is grilling a candidate or asking a DS candidate basic easy/medium leetcode questions is also considered unreasonable.

Can you give examples of how you would assess. Its easy to tear down concrete if you are only going to provide vague notions as the replacement because when you have to compare concrete examples you begin to see the tradeoffs

If you like building libraries and are good with HPC and/or low level languages, you could become a software engineer at companies that produce these algorithms to optimize ML libraries.

If you like building data pipelines, infrastructure, monitoring existing models, optimizing a data scientist's code and deploying models in production, you can become a data engineer or ML Engineer.

If you want to integrate machine learning capabilities into applications and websites you can be a software engineer on a ML team.

If you want to apply models to new problems in notebooks and see which models work well for what problem you can be a machine learning engineer or data scientist (at companies where data scientists still experiment with ML).

These boundaries aren't very clear cut, but I see two tracks becoming extremely successful in ML right now:  
On one hand you have people at the edge of research at companies like OpenAI.  
On the other hand you have people with very good software engineering skills implementing research into libraries or building ML systems.   
One option boils down into getting a PhD (Although I would not recommend getting a PhD just to attain a ML Job, but if you have great research aptitude and are extremely interested in what you will be studying), the other option is to get a computer science or statistics bachelors degree, get your masters in statistics or computer science, and become a software engineer in a ML team. (Software engineers in ML teams include data engineers, ML engineers, platform engineers, so on and so on)."	"3_1_2_1"

A funny item too is that \"BI analyst\" also got rebranded to \"Data Analyst\". I think the expectations of data analysts these days are to have more python experience and work in an ad hoc environment. That split off people who were reporting analysts away from data analysts.

I feel like some data teams also started to have more software engineering components like \"how can we automate this powerpoint?\" (Python pptx ftw!) - that was a task that we had and it didn't need to scale fully, it just had to be used by our commercial teams. So data teams were also creating somewhat janky tools, that worked great for what they were. This enabled the team to engage with new tools outside SQL and it became a way to differentiate yourself amongst candidates (data wrangling experience).

Some tools started to be created to replicate some basic analysis which was great, then we could focus on harder problems for the business!

I think what's tough for people these days is not having this organic ramp up with tools they are asked to master. Like why learn python? Why become familiar with R? 

My company now is looking for people with dbt experience, I think that will be a new common target. However, this is for data / software engineers to have that experience not data scientists or analysts like I would expect from even recently."	"3_2"

I think the number one reason why otherwise impressive candidates don't get hired is that they lack a complete skill set. 

We get a LOT of resumes for entry-level positions where the applicant has advanced training in CS, DS, and/or stats. But during the interview it's very clear that they have no idea how to apply that knowledge to real world problems and/or can't effectively communicate the results. As I often say, it's not what you know that matters; rather, it's how you let other people know what you know. 

I'd rather hire a good natural problem solver who can present and write up findings who only understands OLS regressions because it's easier to teach them the subset of technical skills that they'll actually use rather than someone who knows every technical skill out of the sun but has no clue with respect to non-technical skills. The latter are a dime a dozen. When I hire, I imagine where the person will be in 6-9 months after onboarding and training. I don't necessarily want to hire someone who starts out a little bit ahead but has a ceiling because non-technical skills hold them back. 

At least for my team, writing is probably the most important non-technical skill.

My goal is to eventually become a data scientist. May I ask what in your opinion is the difference between a data scientist and analyst, and what I can focus on?

Currently, the responsibilities of my roles is to guide marketing strategies with data, evaluate effectiveness of a product feature, design experiments and AB tests. A lot of my time is spent on writing SQL, building dashboards, occasionally doing hypo testing or clustering. A lot of these already largely overlap with your description of a data scientist.

Apart from ML, what else should I focus on so I can develop enough skills for a data scientist job?

My education background is in social science, but we had a fair bit of training in statistics. I am currently taking coursera courses on ML and deep learning. What else do you suggest I should do?"	"32"

This overlap could be higher or lower based on the different flavor of data science jobs in the industry. There are broadly three flavors of data scientist jobs: Applied ML Data Scientist, Analytics Data Scientist and Experimentation/Causal-Inference Data Scientist. 

The first thing you need to do is to decide what flavor of data scientist you want to be. People with social science experience tend to dominate the analytics and experimentation/causal-inference flavors because it aligns with their training. But nothing stops you from becoming an ML Data Scientist too. Most entry-level applicants fail to decide their preferred flavor of data science which negatively impact their application experience because they throw apps at every data scientist job advertised on the internet. The ones that get offers become surprised when their data science jobs do not align with their expectations. To prevent getting this experience, decide what flavor of data scientist you want to be before sending an app. 

For Applied ML Data Scientist jobs, the overlap is on the low side (20-30%). The missing piece is predictive and prescriptive analysis. You can get this experience by creating a predictive (ML/deep learning) or prescriptive (optimization) task from your current responsibilities. Can you predict the right audience for your marketing campaigns? Can you optimize your marketing spend by reducing budget from one segment and increasing budget in another segment? You can build out your use case and build a POC. If your result is good, your stakeholders might like it and implement it. 

For analytics DS, the overlap is ~90-100%. You can apply directly to those roles. You have the right experience.

For experimentation/causal inference DS, the overlap is 50%. The missing piece is building more efficient A/B testing processes for your team. Are there flaws in your current A/B test designs or tools that is impacting your results and affecting your business decisions? Are there better A/B test designs that can produce more accurate results for your team?"	"32_1"

I have seen ML projects have $millions impact (and many with no impact when executed poorly). It seems far more rare to see a stats or dashboard project have any impact. Unfortunately, I have never seen any evidence of a decision maker changing behavior due to this kind of work.

The problem is, a significant portion of data scientists do not have the creativity and experience to apply their skills in a way to make an impact.

Power points don't scale, they're created for 30 minutes of talking, then put in the dumpster forever. It's too high level. A well-written, fully detailed report that is meant to influence others will actually be read by a wide audience (sometimes 1+ years after your wrote it). This is how DS works at places like Meta, and I can't emphasize enough to you just how valuable their ecosystem of notes is. Sure, not all notes are widely read, but it's well worth the effort.

Text needs to be parsed, text containts little to no visual clues as to where the important parts are.

Powerpoint enables visualisations to accompany text, its like a higher bandwith and higher fedelity information transfer....

I like a pyramid structure, where the first thing you see is the small high level summary, then a more lengthy follow up with some pro's and cons of the summary and most important additional info with links to sources further in the report.

Oh, and students don't need teachers, they should just read the textbooks. But they don't, and oddly enough, they *can't*. Ideally, we'd live in a world where leaders can read. But they can't. What is worse, neither can most of people. Your teammates, your direct reports, the fresh out of uni newbie - half of them *can't read*.

Unlike a school, where students are suggested things to read, at work the bosses may request that you write a report. Or perhaps, writing reports are a given for certain types of work. In these cases, you need to write amazing reports for it to make a difference.

- Toolstoo is an amazing PPT plug-in similar to internal consulting company tools. It's $20 for a lifetime license and just insane value for the money. Saves so much time in PPT

- Toolstoo is PC only. Another good cheap / free one is Brightslide which is PC and MAC

- Get really good with all the key PPT tools both native and in Toolstoo

- These include Align, Distribute, Bring to Front / Back, Making Same Size / Width / Height, Adjoin, Stretch, Keeping / Fixing aspect ratios, etc. 

- Learn how to use tables. You can use a table and format it so it doesn't look like a table. Super helpful for presenting info in a structured grid, often easier to format than aligning and distributing lots of individual objects. You can also overlay other shapes and objects on top of the underlying table

- With tables I usually never use the built in PPT themes. I always start by selecting the basic no fill with black borders theme. And then format from there

- Learn Shift + Mouse Drag to move things on a fixed X / Y axis

- Learn Ctrl + Mouse Drag to make quick copies of objects

- Learn Ctrl + Shift + Mouse Drag to make quick copies of objects while moving them on a fixed X / Y axis

- Learn Shift + Corner Mouse Drag to resize objects while keeping the aspect ratio fixed

- Learn to use Before or After paragraph spacing, instead of using blank lines between paragraphs. And just stick to using one of Before or After, not both

- Learn to adjust text box / shape / table margins to manipulate small spaces, very effective when you're tight on space. Try to always keep the margin symmetry between either top / bottom or right / left to avoid text looking wonky 

- Copy, copy, copy. Being quick and good at PPT is all about reusing and copying the same stuff or making different variations of the same stuff over and over again

- E.g., Headings, just find 2-3 different variations and use them consistently

- E.g., Callouts, just use 1-2 different variations and use them consistently

- E.g., Numbered shapes, just find 2-3 different variations and use them consistently

- E.g., Bullets, create a standard bullet text box placeholder with three levels in one of your slide master layouts, then just reuse that text box consistently whenever you need bulleted text. And if you need to do bullets in other shapes and tables, then just format them the exact same way. Bullets are actually pretty annoying. I used to have a tool from my consulting company that fixed bullets, but now that I don't work there still hunting for a way to do that 

- Add custom guidelines (not actual shape lines, it's like a separate overlay from the right click menu) to the left / right sides of the slide where you want the content to be framed. Keep your content between those guidelines as often as possible, will look much cleaner. Can do for top / bottom as well but usually I have a header and footer that provides that guide

- Start looking at the slide as a grid, whether large or small grid, you'll start seeing how you can manipulate space

- Learn to customize and setup your quick access toolbar, and save backups, so you can restore if it disappears

- Learn how to keep your Slide Master clean

- Learn how to copy slides and objects from other files without screwing up your working file Slide Master. Usually you always want to paste in \"using destination theme\" or just as plain text and reformat, almost never paste in \"using keep source format\"

- Stick to the PPT theme in the slide master, i.e., use consistent fonts and colors

- Be super concise with your writing. Do NOT write like an academic or college paper. Break everything down into short, punchy sentences. Almost NEVER write paragraphs with multiple sentences. Make almost everything direct, active voice, almost never passive voice. Write exactly what the key takeaways on the slide should be, and nothing more. Cut filler words ruthlessly. You don't even need to write full sentences, people absorb and process things better if they're broken down into short, specific points. This paragraph is example of how NOT to write in PPT, too many sentences together

- OK, I'm running out of steam. Final thing, when you see good presentations, try to get a copy of them. Save one version as a PDF. Then save another version as a blank PPT that still has the same slide master, but you've gotten rid of the content. Then use the PDF as a guide and try to recreate good slides from scratch. This is a really helpful exercise, because you can't just copy / paste from the PDF, it forces you to go through the process of creating things yourself and having to learn how to do the design work yourself"	"9"

Praise fucking be. So much time is wasted trying to account for every minor detail that the punchline gets lost. If someone needs more detail they can ask or set a followup call to dice deeper.

Don't worry about how everyone else uses it. Use it to get your specific point across in your preferred way. Think about what you would want to see, if forced to sit through it and assume it isn't something you know or care much about. What would capture your attention? What size text would you be able to read from across a room? What font is best if you had dyslexia etc.? What colours would you be able to see if you were colour blind, etc?

 You don't  have to include low res images crammed in with text on the same slide. Either have a chart / infographic as a whole slide to itself, or send it to everyone ahead of the presentation in the format you prefer, and have a slide note to remind you to ask everyone to open that document now and look at it. Or screen share as you switch from PowerPoint to the other thing you want to show them, and then go back to PowerPoint again. Practice, practice and have fun. It may be extra admin, but it's also a nice bit of creativity that helps keep a job varied and interesting."	"11"

Resisted powerpoint heavily, largely because I was bad at it. I looked down at the 'good at powerpoint' people, and also viewed them as 'creative' types that were investing fruitless energy in an overly subjective area (particularly those that focused on unique / high effort fancy visual design).

10 years of consulting experience later, and I consider communication skills (including deck/powerpoint creation) to be one of the stronger skills in my toolkit. Clients comment on it regularly, and senior execs ask for my help to better communicate to their stakeholders.

Here are some tips that helped me:  
1. It's not about making visually 'unique', 'creative' slides. Many people are good at this, but it's not where the actual value add comes from - it's a red herring if you're starting out. If I really need to give my decks a final 'professional touch' I outsource that to a designer or analyst that's good at that, but that knows nothing about the content, and they make things look prettier after the fact. Focus on the content, structure, and clarity of communication. 90% or more of slides I've ever created follow one of 5 or 6 content structures, and most of those are 'thinly disguised tables' structurally.

2. Strong powerpoint creation follows the same rules as other written communication. Be clear in who your audience is, objective of the presentation, and what your key messages to support that objective for that audience are. Write out your outline of main point and supporting points, use that to shape the structure of the deck (or slide). Taglines should be able be able to be read top-to-bottom through the presentation (ignoring everything else on the slides) and reader should still be able to walk away with the key point &amp; supporting points you wanted them to leave with. Follow the pyramid principle (lots of good examples/content out there) - this applies at multiple scales within the presentation - both to the overall structure of the presentation, as well as individual slides, or the writing within a slide.

3. Consider purpose of the document itself. An offline deliverable that will be shared offline and have a life of its own needs to really stand on its own and contain all of the important context so it is not misrepresented. A slide for presentation support that will be spoken over should be much less busy and full, so as to not distract from the speaker's key points (or highlighting the key points/data/output). Similar rule applies to seniority or background of audience, level of technical ability, etc.

4. Strong presentations are often dependent on strong writing skills, which are themselves dependent on strong structured problem solving skills. If your thinking is unstructured and chaotic, without following a logical flow, your writing and presentation will as well. Always think about how your points connect (e.g. A causes B which results in C, as evidenced by D) rather than just info dumping. Cut the fat and any language that isn't contributing to your goal.

5. QA your work. Put your presentation on fullscreen yourself and present to yourself in your head. Critically evaluate whether your point is coming across, and whether any part of your presentation/wording looks sloppy. Are you using 12 different fonts or too many colors for no reason? Simplify is almost always the answer. Keep color schemes, fonts, misalignments, inconsistencies, 'jiggle' to a minimum, as these will distract from your presentation, and also make things look less 'professional' and weaken your credibility (fairly or not). As per point #1, you don't need to get super 'unique' or 'creative' here (because that is not where the value add comes from - you just want to do enough to avoid pulling attention away from your points): use a simple monochrome palette rather than rainbow skittle vomit that makes your slide look like a bad LSD trip. Get familiar with the 'align object' tools in PPT and use them liberally - doesn't take long before you start just doing it subconsciously with almost no brainpower required."	"20"

Its a waste of time but I see no way around it. I have learnt the art to some extent. Apparently just making things pretty is an important skill for a data guy.

One is, don't overthink it, it's a tool - try to get proficient with it. Get advice from your colleagues and ask them why they're doing what they're doing. Do they enjoy it, do they do it for the audience? Why do there's think the audience needs this? 


You overcome fear by developing a better understanding and by coming into contact with something on a regular basis. Powerpoint is no different.


&gt; trying to make everything line up the way it should even though it never really does--all to see my beautiful dynamic dashboards reduced to static cutouts. 


You might want to think about what the aim of the presentation should be. Is it too showcase beauty - or is it to get people to understand something and take that newly developed understanding with them?



I'm not saying beauty doen't have a place, it does. You're proud of your dashboard, probably rightly so. I'm saying there's different aspects that your audience might also value and value higher. Personally, I prefer a static slide a) because I'm used to it and b) because it's a fixed representation that I can refer to. 


I've seen enough people jump through a barely rehearsed presentations where their \"story\" didn't really have a direction. You can stop, ask to elaborate, ask critical question - a static slide helps there. 


The other other benefit for me is the following: when I'm a meeting I'm likely thinking about my current project, maybe I had to rush to reach your meeting or I'm otherwisedistracted by something outside our online meeting because 'stuff happens'. Some of it might be my fault but my point is that generally your audience might not always be fully attentive.



If the presenter shows me concepts and numbers from a topic that I'm not familiar with I'll already struggle with following them. If they then have a (highly) dynamic presentation I'll probably get lost because I often do not have the mental capacity to follow both new content and a new presentation style.


Powerpoint is a standard tool but if you want to move away from that within a given it group you'll need to understand, first, what makes it successful and how you could achieve what you want to achieve within the confines that it gives you. 


Otherwise you're seeing not from a point of proficiency but from a point of, well, taste - which is generally an okay stance but not if your audience gets lost.


Try to get better at it, it might be tedious but repeated exposure and better understanding of why it's used will help reduce your fear of it. >á"	"33"

One reason I think ours are (IMO) very successful is that the slides are almost entirely simple and graphic -- photos, simple charts, images of details from interesting historical records. Usually one thing filling the entire screen. We really try to minimize slides that have much of any text. And the words we are saying explain what people are seeing. While preparing the visuals takes time too, we have really cut down on formatting time but also creating a template of a few styles and colors and sticking to them.

There is a significant caveat here -- just showing images can be an accessibility concern, as it's hard for anyone who can't hear us to follow along, and it's difficult when someone asks us to \"just please share your deck.\" So for this approach you really need to separately make notes about what you are saying available separately. I rely heavily on the \"Speaker notes\" feature as I am presenting, so I can export those along with my slides when requested.

I think the good(?) news is that if you find slides boring, others likely will too, and you can use that instinct to hopefully break out of the gravity of lots of bullet points and complicated graphics. Of course, if your company or institutional culture doesn't reward that .... sigh, that's hard. But others will thank you, secretly or otherwise!"	"41"

In the end, PowerPoint is just a tool, it can be great, but ultimately it's the presenter who needs to able to connect with the audience and actually make paying attention worthwhile."	"44"

Put the data accordingly, if youre confuse with the type of charts, just stick to the basics but make sure it is clear. I tend not to overcomplicate myself with sophisticated design, as long as it is tidy and clean, its good for me. Lastly, practice!!

You literally do not need to over design these, it can add to it if done right but the point is to help you covey a story or idea. 

Feel confident with your clean powerpoint, your viewers will appreciate how easy they are to digest.

For things with more complicated flow charts, just figure out one or two designs that you like and keep changing them as needed. Really tho you are not a designer and you should not feel the pressure to be one. 

Final tip, if you have a design team they can help you out depending on the org structure and importance of the presentation."	"47"

It's a communication tool and whatever your job is you will always have to communicate with someone and as soon as they are non-technical you will need ppt. I was just like you when I started, I despised it. 

I started hating it less when I learned about rhetoric and what a good ppt looks like. Ppt is there to support you talking, so it has to be lean. A really good example are the old Steve Jobs talks for the IPhone release. Basically no text at all. No fancy symbols or bs like that.

When I create ppt today, I have just a hand full of really short bullet points, 3-5 usually and only if necessary to convey my point, and often visuals, which usually are a single large picture or graphic. As stupid as it may sound but one of the most important things is to keep your audience entertained. You talk to them for a reason, either because you want them to give you something or to remember something. In both cases, it is important that they give you their full attention and/or remember you. So make it entertaining. In most of my talks/presentations there is something humorous, just something you can smile about a little. Like when explaining NNs to someone I usually use the goofiest pictures of animals I can find. It's a complex problem and you risk losing people. A little funny thing like that bring back their attention. Same goes for the other visuals I use. If you stare at a wall of text in black and white it's just boring. You want people to hold on to something and you want them to listen but not read.

I enjoy communicating in general and when I started to learn how to use ppt for that in a less dry way I started hating it less."	"50"

The gust to a deck is:

1. Title slide

2. Index slide super ultra high level. Think planet mars high level. Bullets here are just the titles of each section of your presentation. You script when this one comes up is, here are the things Im about to cover in this presentation.

3. Sub title slide for section 1 and any nested sections in this section. 

4. Slides for the points in this section.

5. Next section title&

6. Slides&

7. Summary slide.

8. Maybe your contact info to reach out, but these somethings irk me at the end because Im still scribbling notes from the summary or the last sections.

Other things to remember.

Power of threes. Three sections, three subsections per section, 3 bullets per subsection.

Thats not a hard and fast rule, but putting a ton of bullets in one slide is not helpful and your audience will lose focus and forget what youre talking about before you finish. So use them sparingly. If you need more than three, you may just need another section/slide instead.

I hate with a passion sequence slides that are all basically the same slide but each one has a new bullet or something. So annoying when youre trying to work through the deck alone later and you gotta run through like 15 slides to get to the point.

Audience is everything so you could do a master deck and then pull slides form that based on audience and time.

Practice your presentation. Set up a timer and make sure you can get through each slide in like 1-3 minutes, and that you have enough time to let the audience as questions. Whole deck shouldnt take longer than 15 minutes and if it does, it might need to be broken out into several presentations. "	"56"

People get used to the template and therefore spend more time on the content than on perusing the header, footer and style queues. It works at conferences and even customer presentations in that it helps establish a brand. With a nice clean simple template, consistent fonts it makes for ensuring those who are not so good at creating decks have at least a consistent basis to start from. It also means you can pull pages you need from other presentations easily or make it easy for those doing the presentation to clean it up if it was prepared by someone less familiar with PowerPoint.

Actually I prefer the Google Slides product as it allows collaborative efforts in creating presentations and is pretty much as straightforward to use as PowerPoint. Youngsters leaving school or College even are coming out with Google tools experience and less experience in Microsoft Office products due to the pervasiveness of Chromebooks in education. The average graduating high school student leaves with 7 or 8 years of Google tools experience and about zero of Microsoft Office tools. As a runner up would be Apples products as Macs are pervasive in school computer labs and Macs and iPads have the Apple office automation tools installed by default.

Some of these alternative tool sets are not quite as sophisticated as PowerPoint, though Google offers a useful team working environment, but that lack of complexity might be in fact a positive thing - enabling a more consistent brand image.

As someone raised on PowerPoint but having used Chromebooks in education for the last 9 years I would pick the Google alternative every time. The features that are missing, I doubt I would hardly ever use. The same goes for Google docs. The only Microsoft office automation tool I think really shines and is hard to replace as the alternatives dont really stand up is Microsoft Excel. Im afraid to my mind the Libreoffice suite isnt quite there yet, its man machine interface is just too visually confusing for my mind, but that might just be a lack of experience with it."	"84"

From there, there's a few paths 

1.) Get good at PowerPoint - make even more compelling visuals, e.g. become the stakeholder 

2.) Put a lower amount of effort on visuals, optimize for folks pulling data and making their own charts.

3.) Get out of dashboard work and do something else. 

Given your post, my advice would be a mix of 2 &amp; 3.

Given no priors, the best would be option 1. The degree to which an insight is good, is the degree to which it can be communicated. In fact, socializing insights is 80% of the battle. That's why so much work goes into it.

I'm gonna give YOU the benefit of the doubt with a conservative estimate. With the LOWER estimate in London, at 75k you're spending 2% of your before tax income on rent (tax is also higher in London btw, ignoring that because why not)

HIGHER estimate in DC at 200k is 1.25% of income.

So hilariously you tried to throw a red herring in there with the confirmation bias.  Next you performed an analysis which covers only part of the story.

Confirmation bias is when you use limited information to back up your values or views.  

Heard of health insurance?  What about the fact that the equivalent of VAT isn't included in the sticker price of things in the USA and is added at the till.  Do you know about FICA which is sort of like national insurance?  What about how copays work?  Did you know that American cars cost about the same per mile to run even though it appears that petrol is cheaper (petrol isn't really cheaper it's that a US gallon is a different size to a UK gallon)? Did you know that internet is generally way more expensive than in the UK, what about cell phones being way more expensive?

When you, like me, have lived the experience and performed the analysis to understand it, you will come to the same conclusion.

There is a Fee of currently about 7¬ per prescribed medication package.

If the medication is less than 7¬, then I pay the regular price. If I'd have a very low income, the feed would be waived.

If the medicine is more expensive, I still just pay the 7¬ fee.

When someone in your family needs a medication listed for 850¬ as uninsured price, that's a pretty good deal. The same medicine is listed by drugs.com for \"from 6,400$\", about 7-times as expensive. Don't want to give more details over privacy concerns.

Curiously, I couldn't reproduce similar differences when trying to look at examples, that don't affect my personal environment. For instance, for Insulin Isophane, I find a price of [60$/10ml](https://imgur.com/a/HfXMQZW) and [90¬/30ml = 30¬/10ml](https://imgur.com/a/aiu2koj), resulting in \"only\" a roughly factor 2 price difference. 

On the other hand, for Desloratadine, a standard medicine for allergies including common hay fever, I usually buy for about 6¬ for 30 pieces (about 0.20¬ per piece) matching the [online price](https://www.shop-apotheke.at/arzneimittel/A3903027/desloratadin-genericon-5-mg.htm) roughly, coming out to 0.20¬/5mg. The comparison portal lists prices as low as [0.06¬/5mg](https://www.medizinfuchs.de/desloratadin.html?params%5Border%5D=baseprice_asc&amp;params%5Bview%5D=list&amp;params%5Bword_suggestions%5D%5Bunits%5D%5B0%5D=ST&amp;params%5Bfilter_price%5D=), but at that point it's not worth buying online from a company I don't know. For the US, I find a price of [1.40$/5mg](https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/desloratadine), more in line with the factor-7 seen for the expensive medication.

Americans pay just as much in *taxes* for healthcare as someone in the UK does for the NHS. Americans then pay premiums on top of that for insurance. However, if you have to use services, you can expect to pay even more - even if they're in network. There are out-of-pocket costs, that have a limit, but dependent on the insurance policy that can be somewhere in the region of $4-10k. So if you get hit by a car, you pay tax, you pay insurance premium, then you can pay $10k on top.

Then if you go out of network, say because you have to get a diagnostic test done that isn't in-network, you can expect to pay even more, because those of out-of-pocket costs don't go to the aforementioned $10k limit.

The job will come with a defined benefits pension, which would be the government alpha scheme. Unfortunately there's a big misunderstanding that the employer \"contributes\" money into your pension. This only matters if you wish to transfer your pension benefits from a defined benefits scheme. You would be crazy (and probably stupid) to do so. What's annoying is that the government jobs also advertise they \"contribute\" these amounts too. 

This job, if part of the alpha scheme, would pay 2.32% of your salary as a retirement payment from retirement until you die. So if you earned £50K, you'd get £1160 per year until you die. That £1160 will also increase by 1% each subsequent year you're working in a job that is part of this pension scheme. So after year two, that £1160 will become £1171.60. Of course you will also add in another 2.32% of year two's salary. All defined benefit pensions are also bullet proofed from inflation as they are adjusted for it. Last year alone, due to high inflation, my NHS pension was increased by 10.1%.

https://ai.usajobs.gov/search/results/?cmco=AI&amp;s=startdate&amp;sd=desc&amp;p=1&amp;k=artificial%20intelligence

And supervisors and that sort of thing are in the 130k, 140k USD range.   But if you're in Washington DC or maryland those are relatively high cost of living compared to most of the UK. 

One thing to keep in mind here is doing a straight currency conversion isn't how this works.  In 5 years the UK GBP has gone from 1.4 USD, to about 1.08, to about 1.27.  Which is down significantly from 2 in 2007.  That doesn't mean a change of buying power by 40% or 100%.  You're paying local costs for labour, healthcare (or healthcare taxes in the UK), food, insurance etc.  If the pound goes back up 20 or 30% you don't get more money, and if goes down 20% you aren't getting less.  Local currencies fluctuate all the time."	"25"

I'm immensely grateful to this community for all the book recommendations and career advice. Thanks to your guidance, I've transitioned from a sales analyst to a junior data scientist. Along the way, I've immersed myself in learning Excel, statistics, Python, machine learning, and more. I've applied this knowledge to real-world projects, automated tasks, and even developed functions used company-wide. Now, I'm focusing on strengthening my foundation in probability, statistics, and causal inference to make a bigger impact in data science. Thank you all for your support and encouragement."	"28"

I really like it for data exploration and prototyping. Once you get the syntax down, you can rapidly do a wide variety of things -- pretty much all of the things I want to do. And I like that you can easily export PNG and SVG from it.

What takes a little getting used to is that ultimately you are writing VegaLite under the hood, so sometimes for documentation you have to look up VegaLite stuff instead of Altair and then translate it a bit. But that has gotten much less frequent over the years. I also like that it can be easily integrated into my Python notebooks.

So if you are already doing data analysis with Python, I'd recommend. If you're using something like R or Javascript for that part it might not be the right fit."	"11_1_1"

But I gotta say, you will pry matplotlib out of my cold, dead hands. It's just so gosh darn flexible. Couple of examples:

You can't set a starting radius in polar barplot in plotly. A plot like this is very hard (if not impossible) in plotly:
https://www.kymat.io/gallery_2d/plot_scattering_disk.html#figure-reproduction

imshow interpolations in matplotlib have no parallel in anything else. Altair \"heatmaps\" are a joke in comparison.

Probably many other examples. I normally don't struggle at all to create complex plots in matplotlib. At the very least I know no matter what it is, it's possible. Can't say the same for the other plots.

Where matplotlib sucks/struggles is interactivity in an HTML setting. So probably not the best for dashboards. But then again who cares about dashboards... business ppl want a ppt with screenshots lol."	"29"

On the other hand, Id say Piccolo got it right about all of it. However, and proportionally speaking, I believe we are facing a much of a market saturation in the Data field as well; but nothing absolutely crazy as every single job posting having +400 applicants. 

Compensation speaking, American and Europeans companies come here looking for young and cheap human talent. The job offer I declined was about 6.600 dollars/year, which I know is inhumane considering NA and EU salaries, but for a junior role here its relatively tempting. Its technically a low salary, but nothing too crazy to at least not give it some thought as a junior.

Experience wise, and with the exception of those two job offers, all employers were requesting 2-3 YOE after graduation at minimum. Sadly, Junior market is also non existing here.

Compensation wise& Id say its an interesting topic to talk about. I know many engineers friends of mine whose 1-2 YOE helped them nailed a 12.000-14.000 USD/year salary, which is a shit ton of money for a junior position/fresh graduate. Those are the lucky ones. Our salary expectations for us mortals, and specifically me who did not come from a STEM background, could vary from 5.000-9.000USD/year.

Tech and remote work has broadened the competitive field.

This is how the cookie crumbles. 

I don't care if you went to Harvard, I care if you do good work. Most Americans want to spend 80% of their time sending emails, complain about being overworked, and make 180k + equity.

The writer stated that data scientists need to incorporate business readings into their daily preparation.

And, again, if a data scientist at a given org is not studying data relevant to the business, what exactly *are* they doing?? Studying datasets entirely unrelated to the business lol? Like, sure, its accurate, but thats like telling a software engineer that if they spend their time building apps entirely irrelevant to the business, they will get fired. It just seems like a kind of stupid non-statement. Yeah, got it, if you dont do your job, you will be fired =M

And then why would a data engineer help with this problem? You provide a plausible explanation, but I think you have to impute a lot of meaning to the authors words to get there.

I think OPs implication is that the AI tools, data Viz and analysis platforms are getting so user friendly that business users are going to be able to do it themselves. So once data is onboarded in applications by data engineers, they no longer need a ds to do it.

Couple of problems:

- most business-side people can barely work with excel. Doubt they are capable of doing actual statistics, formulas and transformations, even in-tool. For now, even the most basic dashboarding roles are not automatable.

Data Science is usually a statistician or actuary with some level of domain expertise that does modeling (and knows how to do hypothesis testing) and analysis of data in that domain. While they should be proficient in a language like R or Python, anything else is good too as long as its not just Excel formulas. They may also be a domain expert with sufficient statistical training (e.g. a phd researcher involved in clinical trials).

Data Engineer should be someone with a software engineering background that has specific knowledge in setting up data processing pipelines, knows SQL and can develop data objects (even if youre largely working on unstructured data in a data lake), is proficient in at least a couple languages, and is largely knowledgeable on distributed processing techniques and solutions.

What IS true is that a fair amount of DS work overlaps with DE, and being good at DE makes you a better, more well-rounded DS (and arguably, having some quantitative analysis background can make you a better DE, too).

There is also a subset of common problems that both DEs and DSs can solve, mostly involving the surfacing of insights and basic descriptive analysis. Many DEs (like myself) have some DS background or were an analyst at some point. So for a subset of problems, you can solve them without hiring a data scientist.

So my score is that the presentation is over the top, but that there's a nugget of truth about the overlap between data science and data engineering.

&gt; It seems like the main career growth data scientists subject themselves to is learning the API of some gradient boosting tool or consuming superficial + shallow + irrelevant knowledge. I dont really sympathize with this learning trajectory because Ive never felt the main bottleneck to my work was that I needed some gradient boosting tool. Rather the main bottlenecks Ive faced were always crappy infrastructure and lacking (quality) data, so it has always felt natural to focus my efforts toward learning that stuff to unblock myself.

https://shakoist.substack.com/p/why-business-data-science-irritates

&gt; Scientists come in wanting to build cutting edge models, and most of the time we have to crush their dreams, and tell them to start by solving the problem with SQL, and if absolutely necessary, a linear regression. If we do end up using more complex ML, the hard part is going to be constructing the surrounding software system, and the actual model implementation will be a by-the-book approach, and constitutes 2-5% of our codebase by lines.

&gt; The smartest staff scientist I ever worked with once told me My job is to tell junior scientists their ideas are bad, but they should feel good about them. And to tell senior leadership their ideas are bad, and they should feel bad about them. This is career progression in industry data science.

Basically, my career has been about solving problems. That's what I enjoy doing. The reality has increasingly been that the problems that need solved are infrastructure, not math; in fact, most of the problem is engineering, with a small core of math in the center. The industry is trending in such a way that the job of a \"Data Scientist\" is a small, narrow, isolated role that in many companies adds little value relative to the effort that is put in. Endlessly tuning a model that you run in Jupyter and feed shit is what passes for data science in some places, and my personality is such that I can't simply put my head down and work when things are so obviously badly designed. I will do that if I have no choice, but at this career step I have the choices.

This isn't universal, of course. The large tech companies have the actual infrastructure where the people tuning the models have good data and good infrastructure. If you enjoy doing that model tuning and you're in that place, you can do that narrow job more productively. You're still subject to the more foundational philosophy of science issues discussed in the posts, but you're at least not obviously engaging in nonsense.

But I've worked at one place that had the infrastructure and tooling I'm describing in my 13+ year career. I'm pretty sure something like 90% of companies \"doing data science\" don't have the right tooling and data to be successful at it. I've worked places where a few months in I told my boss \"you shouldn't have hired five data scientists, you should have hired five data engineers because the data and infrastructure is a trash fire\". Then I spent most of my time there doing engineering work.

So yeah. I like solving problems and in practice, as a data scientist, my ability to solve problems has been based on my ability to do engineering work. Every job I've had over the past few years has increasingly focused on doing engineering (at one point I was basically just a tech lead for a backend engineering team, even though I was a Principal Data Scientist). I enjoy engineering and I enjoy making tangible progress toward solving problems. Combine all that together and moving to Data Engineer from Data Scientist is a logical flow."	"10_2_1"

No one knows how to use data scientists appropriately. And hardcore data scientists are usually stats savants who cant publicize their value or communicate with stakeholders. 

But remember, data science is a framework/ideology, not a rote function or toolkit. Its about devising testable hypotheses and delivering actionable insights. This is where I see many data scientists struggle. Sure, their explanatory model is 90% accurate, but can they advise sales teams how to leverage the findings? Can they advise salesforce admins how to design layouts to best capture sales rep inputs for customer segmentation. Can they deploy operational models with online inference?

Additionally, if youre not a full stack data scientist who can engineer data pipelines, then youre worthless unless there is an entire dedicated data engineering function to support you.

\"If you are a Data Scientist and you're not consistently spending time learning about how business operates, then prepare to be replaced by a data engineer\".

This is what I interpret: if you consider yourself to be a modeling purist, someone who thrives on just getting datasets and building the best model for that dataset and objective regardless of what the data represents, your job future is at risk because that is by far the most likely aspect of data science that will be automated.

And that is all true. With very few exceptions (really cutting edge models), the part of the process where you take a clean, well-defined dataset with a well-defined target variable and do cool modeling tricks to get the best model out of the deal - that is the least valuable and most replaceable part of a data scientists job.

The hardest part to replace is the part where you take a business process, you identify an opportunity to improve it, you abstract it into a mathematical representations, and get the data that represents it. That is the skillset that people who are good at math tend to excel at, and that people who are bad at math - no matter how much AutoML, GenAI, etc. you arm them with - will always be bad at. 

Someone who is bad at math can probably be taught how to train and deploy an ML model today. There are enough tools that if you want to put the effort to make it really easy, you can make it *really* easy."	"43"

It can also come in handy if you're experimenting with neural nets or optimization algorithms in general, come across something that doesn't work, and want to figure out why so you can fix it deliberately. It's particularly important if you want to work with a non-standard space, such as a space where your objects are volumes instead of points, because you're going to need to know whether any of your libraries will work with that space's metric and dot product before you waste time training a garbage-in/garbage-out model.

I had all of these and safe to say, 90% of my fellow students just passed the test but they don't really \"know\" the math. There's a big difference between learning it in a way you can use practically, and learning it to pass an exam. I only started to really learn it intuitively once I finished school and started to self-study with intention, in a deeper way.

Btw, this is why I mention elementary school math. It might sound ridiculous. But while most people \"had\" elementary school math, they don't know much of it. Even though it could be useful once in a while. So it might be worth going back to relearn it."	"12_2"

I think focusing on the math for long-term satisfaction would only deliver the best ROI if you like the math to begin with.

I personally found it focusing on the business problem has provided much greater ROI and long-term satisfaction.

The reason for me is fairly simple. The business problem drives everything else and if you aren't solving the business problem then you are providing value to your employer/customer. Focusing only on the math or primarily on the math leads to people developing beautiful and elegant models that provide solutions to problems that don't exist or aren't important.

I think that mentality stems from the academic world where you can spend your career studying a particular segment of your field, regardless of whether it provides some quantifiable value to someone. And that is really important. A lot of major discoveries came from people studying areas that were thought to be dead ends.

However, just because that can be a worthwhile endeavor for some we shouldn't dismiss the value of focusing on solving problems that actually exist and are important to people/organizations.  I get a high from seeing the impact of what I do."	"13"

Understanding fundamentals has helped me in more ways than I could imagine. At my last job, there was a PhD on the team and he was a PhD to the truest embodiment of one -- loved research, pondering questions, experimenting with new solutions and deriving results. One time I was working on a project with a bunch of different models, one of which was a logistic regression. I was performing probability calibration on all the models and he noticed I applied to the logistics regression as well. He went on to explain how that was not necessary since scores from a logistics regression model are already calibrated by design. He knew my background was in math and so he sat down and whiteboarded a derivation to show just that. It was quite eyeopening to be honest, and I think thats the most important part about math -- its a language. And knowing the language at a deeper level will let you 'communicate' and comprehend better all round.   


Recently I was applying for another job and there were some techniques I was unfamiliar with that fell under the umbrella of techs I could use on the job. After some research I had a superficial understanding but didnt know WHY it worked. I later found two foundational papers for developing the methodology -- both linear algebra heavy... and having that math background at least let me chew away at trying to understand what was going on. After a couple read throughs I think I had a decent understanding. During the interview, I was asked about this tech -- to which I was now prepared to explain without that superficial bs sprinkled on top."	"19"

Is Maths important for Data Science? Yes, unquestionably. Is it the only thing that's important? Absolutely not.

If you're relatively weak in Maths, as a Data Scientist, studying up on some of the fundamentals is probably good \"ROI\" in terms of use of your time vs increasing your value as a DS. But beyond a certain point, that ROI will tail off steeply unless you're aiming for a very niche, Maths-heavy domain.

At some point, for example, in many cases it's not going to matter much if you can proof out all the Maths of the Adagrad optimizer on a white board if you can't write production standard code or create unit tests.

I also like being able to think about and anticipate bugs, which results in higher quality code. And when I do find bugs, and fix bugs, I like writing tests against those bugs. And I like knowing that if those bugs ever pop up again, they will be easy to find and fix.

Serious answer: I cant speak for everyone trying to get into the field, but for myself I got into it because engineering/programming alone doesn't scratch my curiosity itch.

I worked in web engineering for 5 years and hated it. It was boring drudgery with basically no intellectual stimulation. If I were in data engineering I would probably hate it. MLE?

\"If I'm 100% honest my interest in Data Science doesn't come from the traditional 'Data Science' part. It's an interest in AI and Machine Learning which are generally grouped along with it in online 'Which tech job fits YOU?' articles. To my knowledge they're different disciplines, but require a somewhat similar skillset. Though I'm probably a bit off the mark.

That said, I'm not married to the idea other than as a general direction to point my tech career in and plans will probably change as I become more informed of what data and data related jobs actually entail. As opposed to the over-inflated 'Join our course and be a data scientist in 8 months!' stuff people with something to sell me try to push. Tech as a field is just kind of overwhelming with how many disciplines and sub-disciplines there are. So I'm more inclined to shoot for an umbrella term that's close to what I want rather than picking any specific job title and going from there.\""	"18"

Most of what you're doing as a software engineer is not really tackling \"hard problems\" in the same way. 

A software engineer will be tasked with building an \"app\" with X,Y,Z interface that offers U,V,X features with T latency. But the vast vast majority of the time, there is not really any concern about where it is doable or how doable it is. Its mostly a question of how long it will take you and how reliable it will be, etc.

But data science on the other hand, is usually focused on really difficult problems that literally nobody knows how to solve and we don't even know if it is solvable. Or even if it is solvable, how solvable will it be and how close can we get to our desired outcomes? This makes data science work a lot more gratifying for me personally over typical software engineering work. 

One last thing, but data science also has the benefit of blending business with software and statistics. Software engineers don't have the same focus or involvement on the core business and value propositions in the same way. Depends what you prefer best, software engineering is great for problem solving and building though."	"20"

So basically had ahead good possibilities for a career in data science.   
I ended up pursuing a career in Data Engineering.

There were many reasons that led me down this road:

1) The first one that I encountered is that since there is a lot of demand but not that much offer for Data Science jobs (at least in my country), the entry level positions don't have a lot of benefits and the salaries are kinda low (in general a decent position in this field gets over 200 CVs sent on Linkedin)

2) Second one: most of the industrial technologies and projects are really similar to eachother. In industrial applications (where the gaussian peak of the jobs offer lies) there is not a lot of room to experiment with new algorithms or methods and seldom everything reduces to implement GBMs or NNs (Which could be cool, but it was something I was not that attracted to)

3) On the opposite, Data Engineering Jobs are far more available (less appealing, especially after university), and since there are less applicants salaries tends to be higher and jobs are more accessible (had a couple of colleagues who did not even have a technical degree).

4) Being a Data Engineer these days allow you to learn also a lot of cloud technologies, a lot more to learn, that gives depth to the job. Those skills are expendable in a lot of roles, so if you plan to change role in a future that is easily on the board.

That's more or less what led me to abandon Data Science, nowadays I can say i'm quite happy with my career."	"69"

The whole system ran and spat out 40 reports in 20 minutes on a midrange laptop from 2013. It really is an accessible first project, and it is more than a 100x benefit for a company."	"14_4"

I'll approach from another perspective. Step 1 is to ensure you have standardized blocking across all customers.   What this means is regardless of logo, font color, etc, a graph will be located in the same x,y coordinates for client 1 as it will be for client 2.  Additionally, logo of client 1 will be in the same spot and size as logo of client 2.  This step is critical in ensuring reproducibility across multiple clients.

Next portion is to deal with the customization of brand styles.  I've worked with Tableau before to generate reports of differing colors and what not, and often Tableau's standard functionality isn't enough to allow for this flexibility.  This has caused for me to break open the XML file of the underlying Tableau report and programmatically update it.  In case of your logos, this would be pointing a logo image path location to the path for client 2 when shifting to client 2's branding.  Colors can also be updated as such.  This requires python on my end, and also requires standardization of brand style guidelines and how they are maintained in your system (say json or what not).

I'm sure there are easier ways, but this allows for a high degree of scalability. Anyways, I wish you best of luck."	"23"

on top of that, when it comes time to move your model to production or put it in any sort of service pipeline, converting from notebooks to .py is an additional task which is costly and time consuming - might as well have it done from the start.

my favourite way to do this is to create functions, classes in notebooks, test them and visualize the results, troubleshoot, etc, and then immediately store them in .py files

if they are needed again in notebooks, I import the class directly instead of defining everything there.

you can now reuse these .py code chunks, its easier and more user-friendly than having to use jupyter to see your code, and its much easier to version control.

At the start, the details are all hypothetical and untested. You, a data scientist, have a hunch that you can solve the problem. You suspect you can use a give bundle of features and a given bundle of preprocessing steps and your favorite ML algorithm. You're pretty sure you have a good training set and good labels. But you also know at least one of those assumptions is probably wrong in some stupid way, and you're going to have to modify something. Possibly everything. You know that you might not simply have to try a bunch of things; you might have to try a bunch of combinations of things. The potential search space at this stage is very large, and no matter how much of a badass DS you may be, it might take a lot of iterations before you find a methodology that works. At this stage of the process, you need to optimize for writability. You need to be able to spend as little time coding and as much time testing as possible. You need to be able to spit out whatever graph or table or heatmap your heart desires as soon as you think of it. Notebooks are superb for this stage of development because they stay out of the way and let you bang rocks together without complaining about all the noise.

Congrats, you went through 100 iterations in a week thanks to your notebook; and now it's time to talk to engineers. Well... that's going to be a problem because your notebook is an absolute mess. You spent a week descending into the depths of hell, and everyone else looks at your notebook and sees incantations of a madman that mysteriously solve the problem. You need to take these incantations and translate them into code that's optimized for readability. This can either take the form of a new notebook or .py files, depending on the situation. But the end result is going to be something that is exceptionally linear, has lots of comments saying what you're trying to accomplish, and uses very plain implementations of things. If you did something complicated, it probably needs to go into a function of some sort, so the nastiness gets compartmentalized. This is where you take your mishmash of magic and turn it into a clearly defined pipeline. This is also the time where you go and start writing documentation on the solution's methodology.

At this point, it's time for software engineering. You have a solution that's presumably going into production. That means it's going to be a living artifact, taking stuff in, spitting stuff out... eventually drifting into the ditch if left unattended. At this stage, \"your\" code has to be optimized for maintainability. Someone, whether that's you, engineers, or ops, has to make sure the solution fits into production infrastructure and is easily modifiable. This means incorporating software engineering principles like encapsulation, separation of concerns, etc. You'll almost certainly need .py files for this (or Databricks notebooks instead of Jupyter notebooks) because someone is going to need to set up functions and classes and enums and configs and all that fancy crap that gives DS's headaches but keeps everyone else around them sane.

It's worth pointing out that, the more of this lifecycle you can handle on your own, the easier it'll be for everyone around you to jump in and work with you. You might not be responsible for all of it, but being capable of it will let you anticipate their needs, including the need to convert to .py files at some point. You'll also find that, by writing library code in .py files, you can start building your own personal suite of standard tools and significantly increase your productivity."	"1_4_2"

Another solution is Databricks and other cloud based notebooks.

Another solution is to use another version control system, one designed for data science instead of git.

Another solution is using a plugin that saves your notebooks as .py files from the get go and lets you open them back up as notebooks.  This historically is what I've done."	"9"

They do exactly that, they have a git repo in the back, but it is a linear history, there is no branching or merging. 

Diff-ing commits on the same branch cause the same issue, you are absolutely right, this is circumvented by databricks by letting users work in the same notebook, so you (hopefully) never reach a point where you have diverging versions of the notebook. Though I had notebooks \"breaking\" when I was working with a colleague on the same notebook, when one of us had an unstable connection. By breaking I mean, that some changes were simply overwritten.
The reason I said no-branching is that merges and merge conflicts are much less likely.

&gt; If you're encountering merge conflicts or anything complicated then I agree with others that you're using notebooks wrong

I mean... any serious software project will have merging conflicts eventually? That's literally the reason why there is git. I'm curious what kind of projects you are working on when you never experienced any merge conflicts? The only setup in which I can imagine that, is if you always have personalized notebook, without people sharing them or have them shared via a tools like databricks, that simply overwrites potential merge conflicts by removing the conflicting section. On databricks though I see people copying notebooks constantly to work on different versions, leading to diverging code within the notebooks.

I get that merges and branching might be an eventuality for large projects eventually. I wasn't careful with my words in that regard. Azure tools are pretty new in my org, and teams I've interacted with tended to do notebooks for experiments by a single person, and sharing of code or publishing to git repos as python scripts.

On databricks you will not encounter merging issues, but if you are unlucky the most recent changes will be overwritten without any notice, when two people work on the same notebook in the same cells, if the connection is bad. I believe that they keep updating the file on the server every couple of seconds if you are unlucky and your colleague writes in the same cell during the seconds you lost connection your stuff may be gone.

You are correct: we are actively addressing some of these fundamental flawsreproducibility, maintainability, reusability, etc.

In Jupyter notebooks, the code you see doesn't necessarily match the outputs because (1) if. you delete a cell, its variables stay in memory,ls may still reference, and (2) users can execute cells in arbitrary order. This leads to widespread reproducibility issues. [One study](https://blog.jetbrains.com/datalore/2020/12/17/we-downloaded-10-000-000-jupyter-notebooks-from-github-this-is-what-we-learned/#consistency-of-notebooks) analyzed 1 million Jupyter notebooks and found that 36% didn't reproduce.

Because we have a deterministic execution order, we don't need to store the outputs (you still can if you want for side-effectful execution or sharing). This allows us to store these as .py files. This leads to smaller git diffs. Also, the .py files have no \"magic\" in them, so you can run them as python scripts."	"13_1_1"

Started doing my analysis, deal scoring, win/loss analysis, etc. Kept telling them that clerical data issues were making things difficult but I powered through. Got clever with my logistic regression models (didnt want to use deep learning because model explainability was important). 

I ultimately told them that 80% of their pipeline was garbage and there were a few simple things they could do to improve their chances of closing deals. But that I also needed more time to incorporate new datasets like rep performance and firmographics. 

They ultimately didnt care and just wanted me to give them an end of quarter sales estimate. Keep in mind my main source of data was salesforce where reps constantly game the system to make it look like theyre successful. 

So, I extrapolated my win/loss analysis out to create an aggregate sales estimate. And I told them that we were on track to hit about 60% of the quota. They freaked out and wanted me to make it look better for the board presentation.

Wouldnt you know, end of quarter came and my prediction was off by about 2%.

What did they do? They told me to stop working on my model. lol

My favorite quote was from the CMO: there is no such thing as bad pipeline; all pipe is good pipe

Yes! But often us DEs gets handed some peace of shit code and told to just deploy it. I've gotten code with hardcoded paths to the DS persons personal desktop. Well changing path is easy. But it should be configurable since the dev/test/prod paths are all different. It doesn't help either that the csv files used as input comes from someone that did a manual export from some end user tool and the corresponding file doesn't exist in the cloud. Now an integration needs to be built by a third party that will do its best to charge through the nose. But it won't end up exactly like the end user tool that did the first extract since the cloud tools are different, and we shouldn't use csv as per the process. So more change to the code. 

Oh and the code creates all kinds of temporary files all over the place. But the cloud solutions only have read access from where the source data is served and write access is in a different place. 

Oh, and how do we segregate end users on markets so they don't see things they shouldn't see. Will all the metrics work when such filtering is added? Is there a process for adding and removing users to the dashboard? Who approves who gets added to the dashboard?

It feels that everyone is given the data scientist title irrespective of the work they are doing. Probably feels like a ploy to attract talent.

In my experience, the most of the so called data scientists are involved in building data pipelines, writing codes for deployment, or even building apps, instead of actually trying to understand the data and find the causation for the business problems and solve them. Model or no model.

His point is that with how critical it is for models to deliver value, that we should be further along in the MLOps maturity curve. Like even with a 100% e.g. Azure stack, it still requires a LOT of work to get code to production.

I understand that custom solutions are always going to require custom MLOps work, but the fact that there's not a brutally easy way to take an Azure data source to feed a model that can retrain and monitor itself and then easily expose the outputs is baffling.

Ive seen cases where a data scientist is paired with an engineer to work on a single project. This setup makes business sense if the impact of the project covers the cost of hiring the scientist + the engineer. Otherwise, it makes business sense for one person to do the science and engineering. This is why the MLE role was developed (I guess).

MLOps tools can achieve 50-60% abstraction but I dont see them achieving 100%. The reason is because every project is solving a specific business project that requires a special way to obtain data, build models and monitor the models.

I absolutely share business logic and the outcome with my teams and we explore it together, but from my POV, you should try to put out the best model that then goes through the business logic right? An example we have is a recommendation algo. Lots of ways to do it, but there are some standard frameworks, and as the business stakeholder, Id rather let you solve the problem (best recommendation for X user at Y time on Z platform) and let me/another feature team determine business rules (X user cant see this content, Y content is boosted because of some other rule). Your model is the ground truth, we trim the outputs down later based on actual business needs. 

Im sure there is a great argument to be made that you need those as features, but at the end of the day you getting in the weeds on those can at times, in my experience, narrow things so much and put burden on you that isnt necessarily productive

It was not.  More often than not, I have re-written model code to fit the IT production environment to piggyback on the existing DevOps and developer wheelhouse.  Using nonstandard tooling outside of the IT suite of products is tough and has the risk of loss of sponsorship.  However, using tooling that fits into the IT stack can be useful:  SM for AWS cloud, Databricks for a Spark shop, AML for Azure, OpenStep with Pega for an on-prem shop, Seldon for low cost, and Snowpark for my current work (I will kick my own ass later).

Most Sr level DS I know are doing a lot of pipeline work.  However I do not see a DE as being competitive with a PhD level DS.  The are also a ton of shit DS that dont know what they are doing.  Basically model work is proliferating outside of analytics silos and will continue to do so.

Burla is...

* Incredibly expensive at $0.05 /cpu hour
* Quite limited to a specific workflow where I can map inputs to functions (eg data processing), can wait for it to finish and not worry about failures, don't have to worry about the data transfer to the cloud
* Offers no security or privacy guarantees that would allow me to run anything with personal data or data I need to protect for any reason.

You're essentially offering batch data processing for scientists at an incredibly high price. I can think of a few uses I may have had for it when I was a researcher but as a data scientist, I'm not sending my data to you without a data processing agreement in place in order to save myself the effort of setting up an AWS instance."

Also, some additional context here. I tried to go live with a fully managed version, people loved the API but the service was too slow. I went heads down for 3 months to reduce latency so it is under a second. I'm going to be releasing the much quicker fully managed version and then an open source version for your own cloud (the open source version is 100% free)

1) regarding the fully managed version, Burla is 3-5x cheaper than current leaders in the cloud abstraction space... Modal, Coiled, and AnyScale. They are cost prohibitive and it impacts their distribution but a lot of people are willing to spend that kind of money because they don't have to deal with infra configuration and maintenance.  Our open source version is 100% free, you install it in your cloud and the only thing you pay is the standard AWS, GCP or Azure cost. 

2) right now we don't support inter-node communication (we will) but there are still a bunch of embarrassingly parallel workloads it supports really well. Batch Inference, Hyperparameter tuning, Compute and Image Embeddings, Web Scraping, Pre-Processing massive amounts of data, and Monte Carlo simulations. 

3) this is the exact point that made us go open source, we realized that distribution in the cloud abstraction space was really low because most institutional businesses require everything to be hosted in their own cloud. Those businesses are not allowed to use a fully managed service, many companies are risk averse like this. For small Silicon Valley companies they just care about engineering velocity and will use a bunch of managed services, obviously not the case for fortune 500 businesses.

Without Burla you'd typically need to build a compute cluster which is a group of interconnected virtual machines in the cloud. This is time consuming and requires a bunch of infrastructure engineering experience. 

There are other abstractions on the market that make it easier to interact with the cloud. The main issue is configuration is complex and the managed versions are extremely expensive and don't meet compliance rules at many organizations."	"3_1"

We also are releasing a managed version which leverages our own cloud. That will have a modest markup that is 3-5x cheaper than all the other existing abstractions. The reason for the managed version is so Burla is always easy to use, even if you're a python developer without an enterprise cloud.

I think offering both an easily installable open source version and a managed version is critical for distribution. 

There are fully managed offerings but they run in their own cloud and larger enterprises consider it a security risk... and it is really expensive.

If you get stuck, and I may catch some flak for this, but Ive personally found ChatGPT to be an incredibly powerful learning tool. If you get stuck on something, use it to teach you. Dont just ask it to write all the code, but ask it questions about the approach. For example, if youre trying to reduce the dimensionality of data and decide to use PCA, ask it about why and how PCA works. 

Try to build up an understanding with basics like linear regression, logistic regression, etc. and then you can build your way up to neural nets.

It may seem like neural nets are all the rage right now (which is true) but data science in a business context will be the simpler models 90% of the time and the big fancy things will be reserved for only the remaining 10%.

Just be curious. Brush up on math, learn the basics of Python, Pandas, etc. and find something to build that youre passionate about.

Honestly they're just like calculators. In 15 years the market will have adjusted, people will have grown used to it and adapted to using GPTs as a tool. Case in point, it wrote a python code for me to automate pdf creation using fpdf library. Not only did it make me more productive since i didn't have experience with the library, but i also learned the basics of the library and how it's used just by correcting chatgpts errors. In future projects I'll be even faster because i got the basics down and can write my own code with fpdf, maybe use gpt to add new features.

Technically, you don't need a GPU for any model. Although your mileage will vary significantly depending on the model size.

These are algorithms that you can easily run on any modern CPU to make some predictions about data. 

When you hear about using GPUs or TPUs for performance, it typically involves some very large neural network or decision tree. The GPUs and TPUs are just optimized pieces of hardware that can do math very, very quickly. So for larger models where training takes a long time, you can make use of this hardware to accelerate that process. 

To give you a real life example, ChatGPT has hundreds of billions of parameters, and you can be sure that level of training involved some pretty insane hardware. Whereas you could whip up a simple linear regression in just a simple excel file if you wanted to."	"1_4_1"

It always depends on the compromises youre allowed to make and what the goal is. If the data is so bad that you can barely get useful results out of it I dont even bother cleaning it carefully. Id rather focus on using it to develop a concept to analyze better data with and then suggest how to collect it better. Now obviously its not always that extremely bad, but Ive been there. Sometimes you gotta bring the tough news and tell the people in charge to collect better data before they get results. Its might make some people upset but at times thats simply the responsible thing to do. In this case things were so chaotic that they just accepted it, put the project on hold and I ended up leaving the company for unrelated reasons soon after. I heard its unclear if itll be continued at all but they simply stored my work and now somebody else might get to do it or it simply is forgotten. Not my problem anymore I guess.

The problem was the entire workplace was extremely cheap, so there was little experienced staff and those who were, were terribly underpaid and there was a severe lack of organization. I feel bad for the other people there. The analysts and programmers there were largely very sweet people but there were some really toxic people in especially the more business heavy parts of the company and middle to upper management but also some network engineers. Control freaks, severe gossip, cholerics, bullies, power abusers, snitches, passive aggressiveness, racism&Ive seen about anything except for physical violence and sexual harassment. And a family that owned the company that was basically acting like modern aristocrats with zero respect for their employees, acting like little kings. Head of the company is a multi billionaire despite the company including all subsidiaries only having ~15.000 employees (which aint small but for a multi billionaire at the top thats small), their company dynasty goes back for over 150 years now and their parents/grandparents were Nazi collaborateurs when they owned the company in the 1930s. Should tell you everything to how they see their coworkers now. Eventually theyre going to save their company into the ground because theyre consistently scaring off most talented young workers and are late in innovation to the competition in about everything, but I guess with that kind of family fortune it wont matter to them. I hope they drown in their golden bathtubs.

Im glad Im out of there, but I just feel bad for all those socially competent people still trying to jumpstart their career there, stuck there or talented but not courageous enough to leave. Even a few of the people in lower leadership roles that were good people. They deserve better than the wages theyre paid, the treatment they get, the budget they have to work with and the difficult and sometimes straight up horrible people they have to work with.

Make sure not to fall into the shame trap. I have the feeling that this looks more like a blame game. That is what I have seen frequently from Seniors. They give you a comment and run away and expect you to solve everything. 

So the minimum things you do: 

a) Better storytelling. Make sure that relevant people can understand the complexity of the use case. 

b) Take a senior onboard. Talks to your PO and make sure a senior is assigned to you. Make is part of their responsibility.

Literally had this same exact problem myself when I was getting started out. Totally normal, as you get more familiar with the data, the company, and the industry, you will get much clearer ideas of these types of things. You just need time on the job. 

Now, one recommendation for you is to chunk things down. you might not know how long xyz project will be, but you can identify what step 1 will be, you can probably estimate how long that will take, them step 2, etc. Caveat this all to leadership assuming no issues. I'm sure they understand unexpected things pop up all the time.

First step is to put out feelers at work. Talk to your manager about new work. You may be in a situation where they're giving you basic tasks because you're new and haven't realized you're ready for more.

If that doesn't work, then no worries. You have an easy job so can take a decent amount of time to yourself each week. Use this time for self direct learning. Auth, deployment options, model monitoring, networking, front end engineering, cloud engineering, there's a million things an MLE can be asked to do. Go learn some of it.

Then in 6-12 months you'll have 18-24 months experience as an MLE, lots of knowledge for interviews, and maybe some useful certificates if you take something like an AWS exam."	"3"

- Continue your education - online tutorials, journal articles and textbooks.
- Ask your supervisor if you can assist with other projects in the company which are more challenging.
- If you have time and data is available, consider working on self-assigned DS projects as practice.
- Attend nearby data science conferences that look interesting - consider presenting your work."	"5"

But for real, the best networking Ive ever done that has gotten me jobs has not been related to said jobs. Always some extracurricular that wasnt work related. It needs to be something with a consistent crew, requires mixing up with people and working/exercising/whatevering with someone closely (see karate class) that you dont really know or didnt know before the class. 

The meetups I go to lean way too heavy towards people looking for jobs - like all of them that are tech related. Having manager in my title means I go, introduce myself, and get pestered for jobs the whole time when all I want to do is work on nest coding projects or see what others have made. 

P.S. bouldering gym is not particularly good. While some chains conveniently position near FAANG campus and are well stocked with SWE from said FAANG as members, everyone is kinda antisocial if you arent already in their little clique. Only really talked to 1-2 people at the local gym I was a member at a few blocks from Netflix campus. Only time I got any more attention was when I finally landed a dyno I had been working on and cycling through with some people. OTOH if they run a class, maybe that could work if its a consistent crowd. "	"7"

I'm naturally an extreme introvert but I've gotten to know a large number of people and have a fairly robust professional network at this point.  

When I was in the nonprofit sector and working on behalf of a large local foundation, I got to know a lot of people because I did program evaluations (or they thought knowing me would help get them funded). I also completed a non-technical grad certificate (nonprofit management) when I did my stint in academia and I know a ton of people from grad school. 

One thing I do to help make favorable impressions is go out of my way to do favors whenever I can (e.g., show someone how to leverage the US Census' API or show them how to navigate a state site that houses data but is poorly organized). One time I helped someone I barely knew find employment for two people he had to let go; that former manager now happens to be the CFO of the organization that I work for and I think he appreciated me going out of my way to help his former team members even though it was 6-7 years ago. I didn't have anything certain to gain from doing so at the time, but it was in my power to help and it took less than an hour to help them make some connections that helped at least one of them land a job. And now I've got a friend in the CFO, which proved useful last year when I screwed up getting an invoice paid before the fiscal year ended (he worked some accounting magic to transfer the funds to this fiscal year). Often times, Finance is not so accommodating. 

So be kind. Do things for others because it's a small world and things can come back to you if you pay if forward. People remember acts of kindness, particularly when you don't have anything to immediately gain from doing so. Answer random emails from acquaintances of acquaintances. 

At this point, I'm fairly confident that if I were to be laid off tomorrow, I have connections that would help me find a new job quickly. I definitely don't want to test that, but I'm pretty sure I'm well-situated. So basically I networked by doing small (and occasionally not-so-small) favors whenever the opportunities presented themselves."	"12"

This question makes me think you are trying to do something that doesnt come naturally to you, which means you will end up looking like a try-hard which puts people off a lot.
How do you guys network? This advice comes from me who has been an international conference producer. Figure out what you love talking about, and then find who you love talking about it with. Spend time with them - your knowledge and conversations will set the path for you to explore and meet all kinds of people. The most important think is that networking happens organically. That means go and enjoy spending time with people first - hell, go and do drugs if you dont know what that natural connection with people should feel like ( I recommend getting stoned and going from there)"	"13"

It was written as kind of a 1+1=2 explanation of networking for professionals in highly technical careers like engineering. It breaks down in very simply language the natural progression of conversation, how to come prepared, how to get a conversation to lead to another, and how to get those conversations to lead to a job. I personally have been offered two jobs using the methods described in the book.

2. What's the goal of building a new sort listing? Is it because current sorting is terrible and why? Or just trying to implemenet a new sorting

3. Is it affecting only user with any specific platform (desktop or app...)?

Assuming the aim was trying to improve user experience for all platforms, so the hot or relevant experience should be on top, depending on the searched words. So it's assumed the goal is to improve the relevancy algo. In this case, \"hot\" experience can be defined as the combination of matching title and good avg reviews, weighing against the price. Disadvantage: avg reviews need some times to collect, also needs to filter fradulent reviews. The ranking can be changed in the future depends on new competitors joining, category competitiveness, seasonality (travel season, price ....) so this is something to consider in the model.

why do this? To me this is a meaningless quantity: why add review average and review count together? they don't add!! if I have a

review\_average of 3  + review\_count of 20000, vs

review\_average of 4 + review\_count of 10 why add them together? they are different units.

why rescale based on min and max.  None of this seems to have a business/mathematical grounding.

so if you wanted to emphasize UX, I would suggest a smoothed review\_average, which you could smooth with the review counts eg review\_average \* alpha + review\_average\_overall \* (1-alpha)

where alpha = (review\_counts/(review\_counts + 10), so review\_averages with low counts (which are therefore more likely to have extreme values are pulled back to the overall average values)

&gt;Should have I picked price instead of review count?  I didn't because I would assume that the revenue generated per product would be somewhat similar  
 

the default would be a fixed percentage, not a fixed commission regardless of the price.



&gt;(I also asked how they take commission and the answer I got was to use price as the proxy for commission which imo makes no sense, the rates wouldn't be the same for all of the prices right?),

I really don't understand - first you assume that revenue should be roughly the same, then you can't understand why commission rates shouldnt be the same/similar?



&gt;otherwise they would not have signed that product plus, for longer term growth I would assume UX would be more important that money generated short term, i.e. recommend things that the user would like more...

&gt;

you seem to be making a lot of incorrect assumptions/showing ignorance. 'in the long run we are dead'

&gt;should have I used the inverse of the review count to treat this problem more like a multi armed bandit with the UCB strategy?

1. As a business being able to work out what products are making you the most, or costing you the most is important. Your ranking algorithm needs to help sort that. So price/revenue \* frequency is a good starting place
2. Here you can talk about the flaws in the assumptions you make, eg if you're using review frequency as a proxy measure of frequency, that it might be oversampling the ends of the distribution, and undersampling the middle.
3. What happens in 6 months for tourism? Well you go from summer to winter, or winter to summer. So a bunch of touristy activities that may be very popular in summer would drop down to 0 during winter and vice versa.

From 3 you can kick off that you'd use frequency of dates of purchase, redemption or booking of activity as a proxy measure for when that activity takes place to see if you can generate at the very least, whether an activity is a summer one, winter one, or invariant to time.  


As a business I'd love to know with data which things we're recommending that are doing well all year round, and which ones we should advertise/promote seasonally.  


The key thing I think you missed in this interview is that data science is about helping solve business problems by using the data you have available (or working out how to get more). To solve business problems you still need a working mental model of how that data is generated.

As a scientist in general, you build a mental model of how you think something will behave, and then you conduct experiments to attempt to falsify that model. As a data scientist in that instance, my mental model is that many of these activities are seasonal, and the temporal component of them will play a large role as to their profitability. The experiment I conduct to verify that is to pull out the data I do have available to be able to give each activity it's temporal variability score, then make a bubble plot of each activity with it's price, frequency and temporal variability.

With that I can present to my key stakeholders something they can visually grasp and understand which gives them a clear picture of what type of partnerships they should pursue with different activity providers and which ones they could potentially drop.

Best part is I'll build this to be entirely automatic so now the key stakeholders can check it whenever they want."	"5"

* What is the company strategy for these \"experiences\"? Is this a new venture?
* What is the target demographic for the experiences? Acquisition strategy for this demographic?
* Who is going to be looking at the metrics? Is it for a one-time decision or to inform some downstream process? I'm sure not going to design some fancy model for some snap leadership decision

Note, I do have experience in B&amp;M/ecommerce retail and marketing so my response is going to be a bit more informed than what is typical for a candidate. The interviewer should also have some adjusted expectations for the level of the position. Judging from what you wrote of your answers, I think you really dove in to the details too fast. For an open-ended question like this, they want to know whether you're using sound logic to identify a metric that's actually useful to the business.

Some disadvantages are that you may miss out on a higher commission sale to provide a higher rated service.

1. Weekly change in review count (you talked so much about ML and didn't suggest a little feature engineering?). This method essentially sorts by what others are doing and intuitively solves for the seasonality problem listing summer activities at the top when it's winter, skiing in the summer, and so on. It also lets customers do some of the curation work for you which takes some of the guesswork out of it.
2. People tend to only leave reviews for very positive or very negative experiences. This simple sorting method will bring negative ones to the top as well, which would lead to bad recommendations. To remedy this, weekly changes in avg review rating would need to be considered.
3. The biggest one is seasonality. If it's currently hot out, it'll be cold in 6 months (clearly the 6 months was not an arbitrary number) and people will shift to doing more indoor activities. A simple way to predict would be to look at the recommendations offered 6 months prior. Another less noticeable one is the macro factors. If people are spending less money and time in Paris, you'd expect such trends to continue and see people focusing on cheaper/shorter experiences in 6 months.

And to answer your questions:

1. why ask a question that doesn't allow me to use ML? I'd argue anyone can use ML, especially with how everything is wrapped in a package or module these days, but not everyone has critical thinking and analytical skills. 
2. If this was a business case why didn't I get more context? It's not a business case; you were asked to sort a dataset. 
3. I then asked what was their current approach for sorting these listings and she didn't answer... There's no reason for her to tell you, especially since you gave up on the interview. A better way to ask would be \"how would you think about these questions\" or \"what sort of answers were you looking for\" and there would be no reason for her to not tell you since you gave up anyway."

It's not super terrible, but it can be a bit draining. The good and bad side is that a lot of questions you'll come across are similar so getting a few key answers to them is a good strategy, then you rework it slightly for each job. But I also have ADHD so repetitive rote work like this makes me bounce right off most of the time.

There are also different strategies you can take when job hunting. You are lots of stuff about \"x applications over y months\" but I think that in a field like data science, quality trumps quantity when putting applications in.

We had a situation within the last week or so where we found something wasn't working as well as what analysis of it over the previous two years showed. In that case, I think it was absolutely appropriate for them to want to better understand the methodology because we had two years worth of data that had shown that it was effective (even though it was the exact same methodology that had been used in 2022 and 2023).

On the other hand, most other times their understanding nothing more than based on a hunch/instinct or faulty assumptions. The empirical evidence--often just descriptive analysis--is questioned because it doesn't support their preexisting assumptions that have been easily disproven. 

So I guess clinging onto vacuous truths in the face of strong contradictory evidence is more of what I was talking about. \"If X, then Y\" is always true when X isn't satisfied. So our report discredits the X=&gt;Y hypothesis by showing X wasn't the case in the first place and then corrects the premise. Showing X=&gt;Y is incorrect because X isn't true in the first place represents a different proposition than showing X!=&gt;Y."	"1_1_2"

Data engineers typically dont look at them and they can be horribly inefficient. There is no real expectation that DS would write efficient code, they just YOLO it. Also there is no clear process to promote widely used data models to be owned by the DE team. A couple jobs ago, all DS were working in the same dbt directory. This forced us to keep it very organized and we would all become relatively proficient in dbt. As a result we actually wrote tests, thought about materialization, partition etc.. and overall data quality was a lot better. Granted that was a startup and Im now at a very large tech company but I think we could establish a similar process.

I would also fight agism. Instead, a program should be introduced, so that all employees above 45 are eligible to do a (not too expensive) masters course at the cost of the company, to upskill themselves. It is ridiculous that companies are firing people above 45 but the society and the pension system expect them to work until 65. What on Earth should this huge mass of highly skilled workforce do during these 20 years&? Just hanging around as a zombie horde, or&?

* It's not quite true in the US that analyst is entry level and data scientist is senior. Are you non-US?
* Regardless, if you want to work in the field you'll need a higher education degree to be competitive, there are simply way too many candidates and title is a first natural filter for recruiters.
* If you have a job lined up already and are kind of burnt out from school, what's the real issue? Sounds like you're in a great position. Finish school, get some proper job experience and in 2 years think what you want to do. Consider a PhD in something mathematical. But masters are perfectly valid too."	"3"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1awqhei/as_a_new_grad_is_getting_a_masters_an/"	"dfphd"	"2024-02-22"	1708560952	14	14	0	0	"You don't need a MS, but most people's undergraduate programs do not prepare kids with everything they need to know to be ready for a data science role. 

So for a lot of people it becomes a function of having gotten enough building blocks in undergrad to complement that with some self-learning and the right entry-level job to develop the rest - and it's sometimes easier/more efficient to just get a master's.

And that just means that instead of spending 2 years in a MS program that gets you in the door for a DS role, it may take you 4-5 years in a DA role, maybe a job change or 2, and some personal time spent honing your skills to get into that first role where you are now building towards a DS career.

I also think some majors are better suited for that career path - namely the ones that are more focused on the math/stats side of things. Coding is easier to learn on your own/on the job (or at least people are much less judgemental of people who learned to code that way).

Now, the other thing that happens to people that go the DA route - you may just never want to switch to DS. You may find yourself 4 years in getting promoted to being an Analytics Manager, and all of the sudden you could be looking at taking a paycut and demotion to go be a data scientist. Is it worth it? Maybe. Maybe not. Depends on what you value.

My personal advice: don't assume you need an MS until you're in a job search and you find yourself unable to get the job you want because you don't have a MS. And do not assume that  you know what job you're going to want in 4 years - work first. You'll learn a lot about yourself."	"4"

A few practical thoughts about masters, job prospects, and income:

* Opportunity cost of lost income is real, especially if you're available to invest a significant amount of salary early in life for compounding returns
* Online, part time masters are a good option - you can still work and they are much, much cheaper while still being reputable
* In bad markets like today's, degrees probably matter more than usual. But they definitely matter less than relevant experience
* Re: relevant experience, the field is getting a lot more domain-specialized lately. It's worth thinking about if there are specific industries you want to target and may be a more important early-career decision than masters vs. not
* For all markets (but especially bad ones), effective networking is probably more valuable than any degree"	"7"

&gt; I dont really want to go through the process of getting a masters. Im lucky enough to be graduating with no debt and am not really eager to voluntarily get it. The idea of taking 2 years off from making money is not very attractive as well. Also, part of me is just talking as a senior whos tired of school so theres that.

I was where you are at. Just know that the \"tired of school\" feeling will wear off eventually and it'll eventually be replaced with a \"I'm stagnating\" feeling. 

Also, you don't have to take 2 years off from making money/contributing to retirement (and getting industry experience, which is really valuable). There are plenty of data sci masters programs for working professionals.

I work as a DA for a non-tech F50. My thoughts:

1. DA vs.DS is more of an online debate than a real life difference (I can't speak for trad tech / fang). It seems like you're more concerned with the seniority aspect of it than the marginal difference in roles. In any case, a Master's does tend to gatekeep higher positions (as does an MBA, but this is another conversation).

2. Depending on the company/team, you could probably swing it by learning the technical/programming skills. Your responsibilities are what you make of it."	"16"

You can learn. While getting paid rather than accrue debt. And if internally the company has data science teams you can get a foot in the door using any data variant, and work relationships to keep taking a swing at crossing over. A good mentor will do more for you than university coursework. Universities feed theory and are often deficient in practical building. The 'that's great, what do I do with this?'. A good mentor can help guide you to practical projects to apply techniques through building.

Useful frame is your job is not your work, your job is to get a better job. Whether that may be more pay, or more flexibility, or getting access to one of the skills needed for the job you really want. Can use that as a barometer to hop roles. Seek out the item to drop on your resume for what you really want.

As a system for professional life skill-stacking is useful. Each skill you have adds another parameter you can bring to business questions. When every candidate is equally credentialed at some point, an interesting skill-stack can see things other candidates cannot. This is freeing as whatever role you have you can always go out and add another complimentary skill. Ratchet up iterating on your foot-in-the-door diploma."	"17"

The project plan can read like random assortments of letters that have little meaning to those not very well versed in the underlying technology. Even different teams on the same project often have little understanding of what each other do and relationships can fray quickly\*. Surprise problems arise that no one knows how long will take to solve, and just about every estimate anyone gives the PM is a guess.

I think a reasonable response to my post above is that absolutely everyone really struggles with managing large DS projects, including traditional project managers. It could also be colored by the fact that I've tended to work on relatively cutting edge/unique projects.

It's just my experience that traditional PMs don't bring that much to the table. They just end up setting up meetings, sending emails, and updating budget documents. Which is great! I love that there's someone to do that, but it leaves a lot of key PM duties to other folks, and I've carried those responsibilities many times.

The reason you have to track time isnt to satisfy some power trip in the C-suite to micromanage. Its because youre extremely expensive, and GAAP treatments of your time are decisions that, across the entire organization, affect millions of dollars going right to the bottom line or not.

It's pointless to say you have a SOTA model when you've benchmarked it on a proprietary dataset which consists of synthetic time series datasets created by the authors, with no explanation of how those ARMA models were selected.

I simply work in a different industry than you. In my line of work I need to do many one-off analysis projects, my day to day work includes a lot of data-exploration/visualization and reporting.

We don't put models into production all the time, and scalability is also not a huge issue for us, since all of the classification jobs run at night anyways and our forecasting pipelines only run once per quarter.

In general I would say: 
1) If you are more junior than that , this is very unusual 
2) If you are already at that level, you will find that from now on part of the job is to add value to the company through thought leadership. It is just simply not going to be the case that for every initiative you get clear requirements from the business- mainly because they arent experts in your field, like you (how would they even know what an ML opportunity even looks like&?) 
3) Generally speaking, at all levels of DS you should still only pursue something concretely if it makes sense and will add value to the business- or, make your reservations known, disagree, and then do it anyways, and give 100%. In industry your leadership has the last word. 
4) in general , most of your projects should have buy in before you spend lots of time and a clear path to market- talk to other teams if thats not the case - goals help here
5) Crucially in DS- not all projects should be like this. You need to be 1-2 steps ahead of the business - that means not everything is fully specced. / could be foundational
6) Lastly, remember- you are part of the business. In DS , your role is a bit unusual in that if you want to succeed and add value, you should NOT always just do what you are asked (ex-my above, imo) At the core you are a problem solver - that means in general its sometimes necessary to identify opportunities and get after them - whether others see them yet or not.

Anyhow, I've worked with incompetent management before, trying to push ML on problems that can be solved with a simple sql query. You just push back! You should be able to explain why a solution won't work using reason and mathematical proof (as a data scientist), but you should also provide an alternative. If your manager insists on ML, they also should be able to justify with evidence or examples. If you can't explain your position, then it is weak! Perhaps you are the incompetent data scientist?!. If they can't explain theirs, then keep pushing back until they can or leave them.

Let me try to explain without revealing organization. We have a service that is used by millions of Americans daily. Our largest customers can get that service without paying upfront, even though it is not encouraged. They will have to reconcile payment up to 45 days after. Many bad actors exploit that loophole and try to create counterfeit that resembles our biggest customers and use our services with no intention of paying. We can know how much money we lose after 45 days when payment is not reconciled. So the use of machine learning was not pushed from the business that is involved in day-to-day work. It is being pushed from C-level executives who hear that machine learning is used successfully to solve fraud and don't want to hear no for an answer. Our manager is no different. He wants to hear that we are using fancy machine learning algorithms to solve this problem. He doesn't care about details. There are easier things that could be done to stop our customers from using the service without upfront payment, such as payment verification before rendering service. They think implementing that is hard, but some middle management thinks machine learning is this silver bullet that would bring value just like that. Other solutions would allow service usage for customers without paying for some time but send multiple warning letters so that they make sure to send payment up in the future. Even in a rare case we develop a machine learning solution, it is entirely unclear how it is going to be used. Are we going to refuse service based on a machine learning output? That would be all over the news because this is a well-known organization that is used by millions of people. This push is being led by skill-less middle managers and consultants who want billable hours."	"17_1"

This is a typical case for ML! 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;who hear that machine learning is used successfully to solve fraud and don't want to hear no for an answer. 

They heard correctly, specially that their case (customers spoofing/creating counterfeit accounts) is something that ML is mitigating everyday for many large corporates. It is more likely that the C-level suite need to invest in the right leadership and talent to enable this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;He wants to hear that we are using fancy machine learning algorithms to solve this problem

To be fair, this is not a challenge and is often played both ways. Leadership like to hear that their scientists are using fancy stuff. On the other hand, scientists use the simplest logics and sell their accomplishments back to the leadership as the fanciest state-of-the-art AI (e.g. create a rule-based logic and call it ML or decision tree, average two rules and call it \"ensemble ML\", etc.). You sad it yourself \"He doesn't care about details.\", so where is the problem here?!

Look, what you are describing is a typical struggle that you'd face in any large company you go to. It is part of what makes the job fun, and it is why your title says \"scientist\" because you are supposed to discover and invent! you are not an engineer   
 and you are not a policy maker!. There will always be something that works better (e.g. verification system), but the business leaders may never want to implement and they have their legitimate reasons. e.g., maybe their competitive edge is that they don't enforce a verification system, or maybe their competitor doesn't use a verification system so it is very risky for them, or maybe they are in a critical growth phase and want to just pull traffic. So they will favor exploring other options (e.g. ML) even if they can never be as effective. ML is not supposed to beat the verification system in this case, all you need is to just beat the current baseline, and that is something you can definitely do as long as your company has the data!"

On the ML methods side, Graph ML/algorithms. There's overlap with generative AI but a lot of it has nothing to do with generation. It's also a bit off the beaten path from classical tabular ML -- feels fresh but not oversaturated with hype like computer vision a few years back and more recently LLMs. GNNs seem to be in fairly early and active stages of development. Maybe this will be the new craze in a few years and you can get ahead of it.  


On the engineering side, it's been cool thinking more about ML systems design and taking a much broader view on the life cycle of a model. A few good books have come out on the topic pretty recently e.g. Designing Machine Learning Systems and Reliable Machine Learning. These cover a lot of ground that doesn't come up (but definitely should) in traditional ML training/classes. Maybe you're more focused on learning new methods, but this has definitely broadened my perspective and in a way the key takeaway is how good model development can never be siloed from a broader systems view."

Like are their employees children? An organization doing that probably has a ton of other 'old' attitudes in their culture, which means frustrations and possible economic problems when their oldness catches up with them. The main benefit at #1 is the breadth of domains and opportunity to work with more different stakeholders to figure out their needs and translate that into projects, IMO. Whereas #2 sounds much more narrow and probably more about pushing the performance of the model/deployment.

TLDR: I see a lot more downsides with #1, so lean towards #2.

Some other things to consider are the team and your boss (who do you want to work with the most, this is probably the most important factor day-to-day); longevity (where would you rather stay for several years); which set of skills do you prefer developing (stakeholder management/interpersonal/project skills vs pure SWE)"	"9"

I got my masters 4 years ago and fired off I think around 200 applications total. haven't gotten a DS position but have gotten increasingly higher responsibility analyst roles. 2 new roles since graduation.

For me, it's something like 15-25 applications for an interview. 2-4 interviews for an offer. Obviously not going to take every offer. And when I get a new job I don't really send off any applications for the first 6 months to a year or so. Also worth mentioning that a lot of the roles I apply for a \"reach\", in other words a snowball's chance in hell but it takes 15 minutes to apply and it would be life-changing for me so why not roll the dice.

Idk how people are doing 1000+ applications in a few months. There's just not that many job openings becoming available unless you're applying all over the world and/or really scraping the barrel. It's tough out there but if you don't have a single interview offer after let's say the first 50, you gotta rethink what you're doing. Rethink your resume, what kind of roles you're applying to in the first place, etc. You have to be strategic about it - small stepping stones over time rather than one giant big break leap. Not saying don't roll the dice, but I am saying don't only apply to reach jobs.

Also the rate of interviews is not uniformly distributed. Sometimes I send out 30 and get nothing then stop for a few months. Then I'll send one out and get it. Jobs I think I would be a slam dunk for ghost me yet jobs i think I'm nowhere near qualified for will hire me. It's strange how it works like that."	"14"

Being an international student is. A friend of mine who was an international student got his BS in CS and graduated with an MS from an ivy league. By far one of the smartest people I know and helped me out a lot with a bunch of my CS classes. Solid resume with internship experience and several publications on some ML papers at some pretty high profile international conferences. He was unable to get a single interview for the whole of 2023 and recently was sent back home due to his visa expiring. I don't really know how many apps he sent out but I know he had been at it for months and really ramped it up closer to his visa deadline.

In contrast, my resume is pretty lackluster due to my complete lack of internship and industry experience, however I am a US citizen. I sent out about 800, heard back from three, and accepted the offer for one just a few weeks ago. The market is ROUGH for everybody, and being international just makes it 10x harder. Not trying to be a debbie downer, but don't feel bad if it takes exceptional effort to score a position as an international. It's going to take a pretty extreme amount of luck"	"16_1_1_1_1"

The job itself was dead easy and I wanted to be a DA, so I got to work visualising the data they had, improving the quality of the data, categorising it more, showing trends, etc. Slowly, over the course of the year, I was given more and more DA tasks and the responsibilities I was supposed to have just got moved to someone else. I also snapped up a DA apprenticeship course too, which further solidified my position as the guy who does the DA stuff for my department.

Much of what they do translates to non-tech, and the data engineering work is not at all domain specific. for example, any DS application requires high quality data. 

I would approach this guide with the attitude of, these are things I need to understand in order to be an effective data science manager. (Not a blanket endorsement of any article but the ones I saw from a quick scan seem to be high quality.) 

From your post, it seems like you have an MBA but little Data Science experience. As a manager, youre likely going to get the best out of your team by working to ensure that your team clearly understands the business problems that they need to solve and the prioritization of those problems.

Another thing you can do as a manager is create structure around your teams work (e.g. by requiring alignment on the design of a solution before work starts on implementation, breaking large projects into bite-size tasks using Jira or some other tool for Agile development)

In addition to reading these technical papers, Id check out a more business oriented book. This one comes highly recommended by someone I respect, though I havent read it myself: Data Smart: Using Data Science to Transform Information into Insight https://a.co/d/0mfHNxb

For example, in the FDID paper, Kathleen doesn't go into how we'd handle staggered adoption. Or, she does, but lots of the new DID estimators adjust the donor pool/control group some way. They'll compare newly treated units to never treated units, not yet treated units, or some similar approach. In the appendix, where Kathy discusses staggered treatment, she only discusses ATT.

In other words, it's as of yet unclear how the approach of throwing out treated units for newly treated units would affect things, practically and theoretically. Maybe, one could design a best of both worlds estimator, one which combines forward selection DID with this culling of the donor pool in a staggered setting to avoid the negative weights problem/forbidden comparisons.

Essentially it's a systems representation of your core metrics, you map out all the things that drive your underlying metrics - and then the metrics that drive those metrics. If you can build that for the domain you work on, in a high level description for others, and in as much granularity as you need for yourself, then you'll grow almost a felt sense for what's happening in the business.

That's often where ad-hoc requests come from - some business person sees a metric go up or down that they're worried about and they wanna understand what's happening. And once you get a sense of what drives what, then you'll actually be the person proactively analyzing things and bringing it up. This is what creates trust and dependence on you for thought leadership. 

It's a common trap for analysts to be reactive to ad-hoc. Ad-hoc is a response to an ongoing conversation; if you're not in the convo, you can't anticipate. And honestly, as the person closest to the data, you should be driving the conversation. So in essence, you should be doing ad-hoc before they ask for it, if that makes sense....

That often means you end up making bets about what part of the terrain to explore and build maps around."	"5"

I've been feeling lately that this is the #1 thing that lots of organizations get wrong! It's like everyone assumes that ad hoc exploration *has* to be this messy, slow, painful process, because that's just the way it is.

I'm literally right now 20 pages into writing a guide called \"How to be incredible at ad hoc analysis\". It's a work in progress, but I'm happy to share what I've got so far in a DM if you're interested.

There's some solid specific advice in comments already, so here's a couple higher-level, more process oriented ideas that might be helpful:

1. I think that it's important to understand what \"good messy\" is and what \"bad messy\" is for these processes. IMO people too often conflate \"fast &amp; scrappy\" with \"messy\", and wind up with crappy code, processes that sorta work but aren't reproducible, notebooks that have fallen out of date, or projects that take forever to tweak when you realize you have to change something.  
In my experience, with ad hoc stuff there's *always* some thing you forgot that you have to go back to the beginning and twiddle with, and the more painful the process of stepping back through your work is, the harder the overall project is.  
Dialing this in is key. Learn how to be \"good messy\" aka work fast and write *sorta* messy code, but not ruin your life later with undocumented sql snippets lying around in text files, or ten confusing SQL runner tabs open.
2. Make your iteration and feedback loops as tight as possible with stakeholders. This is less important if it's a question you came up with yourself, but if you have someone asking you a question the faster you can validate that you're barking up the right tree, the less likely you'll have to go back and redo stuff. With big datasets, this is even more important.  
The downside is that this can be a slow process in and of itself, but if you're able to get good at doing it rapidly, it can make the ad hoc exploration experience more rewarding (you don't feel like you toiled in the dungeon in secrecy for days) and more efficient (you can catch issues / changes really fast). Most of the time when I feel like i did a \"bad\" exploration or wasted time, it's because I should've shared a more preliminary insight sooner, or asked some clarifying questions to the requester, or something.
3. Closing the loop right can save a lot of time. For me this means two things: either create a jumping off point or a \"save point\" like in a video game, or think about turning your ad hoc work into something more evergreen. If a project is completed and it really was just a one off, taking a few minutes to decide if it's worth filing away or turning into a jumping off point for the next time you need to go down that rabbit hole can save hours next time. I have tons of little starting points that I refer back to often, and it feels fun to be able to pick back up on step 5 instead of step 1. It's a nice intermediary between \"total junk scratchpad\" and \"perfect production dashboard\", and I really embrace it.  
I also think that because of the messiness of a lot of ad hoc work, people are really resistant to turning them into evergreen assets (see: your \"I don't want to own pipelines so rarely worth keeping it updated\"). It's a pain in the butt to take your janky exploration and polish it into something that's acceptable to put into production, that the data engineers will allow into their blessed pipelines, etc.  
But if you do your work just a *little* more neatly to start with, and crucially if you do it in a way that's already really easily reproducible and easy to keep updated (essentially like a bootleg pipeline), it can be a lot easier to promote ad hoc work into production without having to go back to the drawing board.

Anyways, I could clearly talk a lot more about this =. I actually work at a company that makes a data tool specifically designed to make these workflows easier, and I won't aggressively sell you, but Hex does make it really easy to do ad hoc analysis in the way I described above.

The key is the softmax being applied before the NLL. For an n-dimensional output with softmax, there are n ways to increase the output for the correct class.

1) Output more for the correct class.

2 ... n. Output less for an incorrect class

This is because of the denominator in the softmax function normalizing the output (to coerce it into a valid probability distribution). No need to talk about model weights.

I'll also just add on that dataset imbalance is almost never a \"problem\" to be solved. Imbalance can make it a harder problem to learn, but you should never really have to \"solve\" for dataset imbalance.

The actual problem in most cases is the incorrect choice of cost function for your problem.

For example, people love to say that dataset imbalance is bad because the \"accuracy\" metric can trivially be 99% by predicting false for all samples.

But the problem here is not the imbalance, it's the choice of \"accuracy\" as your cost function which might weight false positives and false negatives equally when your problem has different costs associated with each error outcome."	"1_1"

Most people seem to think that you can only use cost functions which are differentiable but this isn't true. There are ML models and algorithms that can be trained with non-differentiable cost functions like accuracy.

Also, I'm using cost function in the general sense of your \"key evaluation metric\" used to optimize your model selection during training.

For example, maybe for your particular problem, accuracy is the most important thing to optimize.

In that case, you might end up training a model with a different cost function that is differentiable, but ultimately you are performing your hyperparameter search with accuracy as your function to optimize.

So in that case, what is really your cost function? In my opinion it is a gray area because I believe hyperparameter search is actually a part of the model itself. But I know there are plenty of sticklers that would argue for hours about how it is technically different, etc.

But at that point it's mostly a discussion of semantics, which is kind of pointless to me. If you want to make a difference between those two, then I wouldn't fault you for it >7B"	"1_1_1_1"

Any distribution involving human interactions has the potential to shift over time and should at least have a time split tested and compared.

For example, take COVID. If you trained and deployed a model right before COVID, it probably should perform poorly in predicting loans because the data distribution changed so much.

So in your testing split, you want to see your model performs poorly on that future period with only past historical training data.

But if you don't split by time, you will actually see your model performs well because it will have some samples from all time periods including the covid period, etc.

Yes it could cause higher error due to distribution shift the farther you get.

However for your second question, I don't think that makes sense.

You have to ask yourself first, how often am I going to retrain this model after deployment?

If you are going to retrain it every 3 months, then your test set should be 3 months long. See what I'm getting at? Always try to simulate what your deployment goal is.

Also, don't forget that you can perform time series CV. So for example, you perform one split where May 2022 to August 2022 is your set set and all data before is your train/validation.

Then you can do another fold where your test data split is covering April 2022 to July 2022, etc.

So in your case, you want a model that can make predictions for all currently active users every month and predict which users are going to churn in that month.

You also want to train your model on all your currently available data and then deploy it on future unseen data.

So to generate your dataset, you should go through every month in the past and create a sample for every user you would have wanted to predict on.

Finally, take your entire dataset and split it by time so that your test set is \"in the future\" relative to your validation set and your validation set should be in the future relative to your train set.

With survival, time is explicitly accounted because your outcome is modelled along a time continuum, but with the classification approach you are looking whether or not the outcomes is likely to occur at a fixed time period (not point in time). And this period is usually arbitrary. Survival also accounts for censoring which you kind of alluded to in #3.

It was a power simulation study comparing logistic reg vs Cox PH. Power in statistics is the probability of detecting a given effect/difference if it in fact exists. And the Cox PH approach was significantly higher (I want to say 30% but again I can't quite remember). 

I think you have to keep in mind that the two approaches are fundamentally different. Even comparing them in terms of accuracy is comparing apples with oranges. In survival for example there's no R^2 (actually, there are many, but they are seldom used) because there's no consensus nor an easy way to calculate it. Concordance measures are more useful here.

Another thing I should mention is that survival is far more popular for inference and explanatory than it is for pure prediction. I suspect this has to do with two things: first, the audience (statisticians and economists and others are more interested in the former than the latter); second, in the vast majority of cases the event is rare to begin with and pure prediction is an unrealistic goal (i.e. not enough data translating in a prediction interval so wide that is useless for decision making).

The fact that the event is often rare in these applications has other implications (beyond survival) with the choice of method: ML approaches are data hungry. This was already known, but In a recent paper (this time I remember the reference!) the authors show how survival forests and survival nnet require 150% and 200% respectively more events than traditional models like CoxPh to achieve the same learning rate (Infante et al 2023). And so when the sample size is not rich enough the stability of predictions goes down. This was shown in another paper by Riley and Collins (2023) (there's a nice YouTube video on their paper).

Right but that doesnt seem like enough to extrapolate to all other forms of ML models.

I'd suggest that you look into CUPED which is a method for using traditional ML models as a variance reduction tool to increase the power of these types of studies.

It shows pretty clearly that models with higher predictive performance will have better variance reduction and therefore higher power.

&gt;second, in the vast majority of cases the event is rare to begin with and pure prediction is an unrealistic goal (i.e. not enough data translating in a prediction interval so wide that is useless for decision making).

I think I'd probably agree here. If you have an extremely small dataset with less than one hundred events for example, then you will probably achieve better performance with simpler models that have lower variance.

I might have to disagree here. I don't think your choice of model structure should have any impact on differing results between dev and prod.

That should be pretty much entirely due to improper dataset splitting and/or construction. Regardless of any model you choose to use, you shouldn't see significant differences in dev VS prod unless you are incorrectly splitting your dataset or generating your test dataset incorrectly.

I can't think of how model choice could ever impact this. Because regardless of what model you choose, your test set construction strategy should be exactly the same."	"4_5_1_1"

I instead want to give general advice that I think this example highlights perfectly (so thank you OP for posting it!): 

**It's critical that you know exactly how your model will be used before you train it**, because you need to train it in the exact way it's going to be used.

That sounds obvious when stated in those terms, but as this example shows, it's actually not trivial. But if you start your problem solving process from the bolded statement, you will probably naturally land on the correct structure of your training data.

Here, the stakeholder wants to know which users will churn in the next 30 days, so that's exactly what your model needs to predict. OP was solving almost the same problem - which users will churn over the next two years - but hadn't actually realized that was the problem they were solving, because the goal was just \"predict churn\" and the data happened to be over two years.

When you start with the end in mind - what is the business question we're answering, how will that answer be used, and what data will we have at that time to answer it - the structure of data your model needs becomes much clearer."	"7"

A significant difference in target distribution is the most obvious explanation for why production performance would break down (assuming that training and inference data pipelines are properly aligned and no other engineering issues are present). If your model is training on a different reality than at inference time, you have to at least make sure that you're validating and testing on a realistic distribution. So, even if some form of resampling is helpful, you can't apply that resampling to validation/test as well.  


It sounds like you've already identified that your problem specification isn't quite right. I don't quite understand your point about balanced historical data over 2 years vs. imbalance each month - if you're only training on the last month, are you creating training data points for customers who have already churned before that month? Unless there was a big actual distribution change each month's worth of proper churn data, including the month at the end of your training data, should be in line with that 4-5% figure."	"8"

What I mean is lets say that you used 2 years of data to build the model, and you are basically picking features at each point in time with target being if there was a churn in next 30 days 

So for Jan 2022 - features of all active customers - target (1/0) churn in next 30 days

Same for Feb 200 - feature of all active customers - target (1/0)

Also consider using a 3 way train/test/validation split and hold out the validation set until you come up with a final model. When you mess around with your model and features based on performance on the test set, it ceases to be truly indpendent. Having that extra holdout validation set for one last check at the end can help prevent nasty surprises like this (though in this case, this wasn't likely the main problem).

Really 3 is your biggest problem. It looks ilke you realized it.

For this you should, at a minimum, be constructing your training set by taking a snapshot of current active users (CAU) at some point each month (e.g. the first of the month) and the target variable is if they churned before the next time point (the first of the next month). There are more approaches you could try but this is the basic idea- each unique user should show up in your training set for as many months as they were active in that 2 year window.


I would think of 2 more as an opportunity and less as a problem. Presumably you're already using some account age feature, as that most likely relates to propensity to churn. You might consider experimenting with features that measure consistency of user behavior over time. For example if a user is active for a certain amount of hours every month without change for a year, even if that utilization is low, maybe that's the amount of time where that user considers the service worth keeping? I would do some EDA around features like that.

Additionally, look into whether missed predictions are correlated in time, either at the population level or at the individual level. Is there some seasonality you're missing?

I would also suggest thinking of this more in terms of the calibration of your classifier rather than just the raw \"did I flag for churn last month\". For example if your classifier says there's a 60-70% chance of churn, how often do users in that bucket actually churn? Do users often show a high churn likelihood for multiple months in a row before ultimately churning? How well calibrated is your model on users who have had been predicted to have &gt;50% chance of churn for 3 months in a row? Are they more or less likely to churn at that point?

These are all just ideas and may or may not work out. You can use them directly as features or create a factor that penalizes/grows probability of churn based on the prior month's probability."	"11"

Yep! That's exactly how I'm presenting the final results to business. Categorising prediction into buckets based on probability. Ex. predictions from top 2 deciles go into the \"high priority\" bucket.

What I personally do is set up Grafana alerts as short as seconds or as long as minutes to query the db if the values are arriving on time, their quality, etc. Let say some agent is not trading for a whole minute, bam alert to the shift trader so he can investigate. 

Some alerts query the whole day back if some temperature has deviated too much etc. But also can check columns min max values, number of entries, Nan values present aka kind of data quality monitoring.

There are many universities that offer online classes, maybe your company can help adjust your working schedule or integrate the courses into your role.
You can try to discuss that with your manager.
On the other hand, I believe that as a data scientist indeed you do need a technical or a data science degree.
There are so many skills you can learn by yourself but the problem is time and effort. You can not do that alone while working a full time job.
There are books that can teach you the skills, yet, it's no dkills proof if u don't have a technical degree unless you have like +4 years experience in data science."	"7"

And suddenly degree programs popped up everywhere, and an extraordinary number of people earned some sort of data-related / analytics-related degree, frequently a Masters. So, the bar got raised, and that is your competition. 

Companies began adding extra degree requirements for data science-type roles, as well as knowledge and experience in multiple tools, platforms, languages, techniques, certifications - the lot. So, when a homegrown data scientist without formal training begins to look externally, they may find a fight on their hands to be seen and heard. 

Many years ago, long before the advent of data science, I became entranced with operations research, but discovered to my chagrin that I could not get a job without a Masters in O.R. That was just the way it was, so that's what I did, working during the day, earning the degree at night. It was tough, but with that degree, the world opened up. If you seriously want to pursue a career in data science, you should consider looking at advanced programs while you are still young because the education gap will not go away and may impede your job-hunting efforts now or later.

DS is of course broader than training ML models and while you can still successfully train an ML model in sklearn without knowing the math, you can't do statistics without knowing the statistics. 

When I interview I ask fundamental stats questions and not knowing them would be an instant no-hire. If you knew some of the math in your ML models that's a cool plus but it wouldn't be a deal-breaker if you didn't.

A lot of things suddenly became a lot less urgent when their last minute requests were getting blasted to leadership.

We can't necessarily assume that since covariate shift can also make the existing model fail.

So the motivation of this approach is to validate that the model performance issues are due to Concept Drift.

What you're describing in the 4 steps is actually a sort of feature importance analysis. Alternatively, for example, 1, shuffle the values of only one of the features, 2, run predictions on them, 3, assess performance of these predictions, 4, repeat for each feature.

Significantly different is probably not a useful way of thinking about this (after all, more data is always better). It sounds like it's more of a question about diminishing returns, or getting a model that is \"good enough\" for your purposes. So, what is this model being used for?

Either way, training is also unavoidable. Youll train your team for GA4 or for your other platform.

With GA4 only, you dont need to maintain a separate platform and a connection between these two platforms. GA4 is the platform and the data is already there. So at the end of the day, you have less things to maintain and figure out by not choosing to complicate your BI architecture.

Id argue other platforms are mostly handy when you need to combine data from disparate sources. Or, if you have like 50 canned reports that need their own custom pipeline: consolidate it all somewhere like Looker. Or, if you have your own in house data that you want to analyze. Metabase is good for that.

Anyways, best thing to do is first talk with your manager. Be upfront with him/her about what the future of the team is as well what he/she is planning to do. It's totally normal to ask about the landscape. For all you know, it could be attractive and lucrative for you. **DO NOT QUIT BEFORE FINDING OUT!** This is important. Don't be like these other guys and jump because everyone else is jumping. That's **dumb**. You're a data scientist, be smart!

Make whatever decision you need to make from that conversation. Personally, I wouldn't worry. Unless for some reason you hate promotions, the more people who leave, the more opportunity you have to gain a pay increase or promotion. As bad as it sounds, your boss is more than likely to give you the promotion down the road because you showed loyalty.

That being said, if you also decide to stay, just be upfront on what less resources means for you. Don't let the business shove more work on you. Actively find out if they are hiring backfills, get involved with that process, and use it to also seek advancement. Assuming you want to advance. Otherwise, just obviously make it known through your manager that if you cannot take on their work, that you need to know if the business plans to rehire them. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BURN YOURSELF OUT!**

Actual real world problems in the industry are rarely ever as simple as they are in a YouTube video. The video I think you're referring to is almost 2 hours long. Let me tell you, the vast majority of software engineers and DS couldn't write that by memory from scratch.

Maybe you use a notebook to create a set of visuals/stats that go into a quarterly KPI deck. Maybe the notebook was an ad hoc study and never needs to be updated after that project. Maybe the notebook is used for model development/prototyping, in which case you might revisit it spontaneously after coming up with some new feature ideas.  


For updating a production model, oversimplifying there are two types of updates:

* 1. Retraining/update of a fixed model specification
* 2. Updating the model specification itself (new features, hyperparameters, architecture/algo)

1 should be built into a training/deployment pipeline, not happening in a notebook. You might be automatically retraining and validating a new prod push once a week or even multiple times a day. You can do 2 in a notebook, so that would happen as often as it makes sense to explore further model development."	"2"

Notebooks should probably be treated as scratch work. If something needs to be repeated frequently or programmatically you probably don't want it in that format.

Early in a models lifespan I suppose it is reasonable to have a notebook for updates and hands on data work during retraining and evaluation.

I'm someone who likes notebooks and I'm guilty of hoarding them but the old ones (&gt;30 days) are very rarely touched unless I need a snippet from them, want to repeat an old adhoc report, or am revisiting a very stale project.

I'm pretty sure I mentioned on your last post but notebooks are really just designed to be notes and you should avoid being dependent on them whenever you can and they should never even see git."	"4"
